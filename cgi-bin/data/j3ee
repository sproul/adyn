Each one may go through several revisions as separate modules. At some point, they are then folded into base Java, tying base Java\'s version to the versions of dozens of smaller yet distinct functionalities. These functionalities are then restricted to a draconian backward-compatibility rule since once folded in, they are no longer selectable modules. Examples include modules that used to be called Swing, RTI, IDL, JSSE and JAAS. These are all good things that should be part of Java. Our concern is that these are not separable modules which can evolve as requirements change.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Java system for evolving the interface (deprecation) does not serve production software very well. Once the interface disappears, the product just breaks. If the Java base were simpler and the more advanced features (those most likely to be deprecated) were delivered as versioned modules, it would be possible for a commercial product to retain it\'s older modules on the system and survive a large number of Java upgrades.]<br>q<br><a target=win2 href="http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs/jakarta-commons-sandbox/cache/">Jakarta Cache</a><br>a<br>Cache (a <font color=red>sandbox</font> project) provides object caching services.<br>q<br>what is the Jakarta software that provides easy-to-use wrappers around the Java reflection and introspection APIs?<br>a<br><a target=win2 href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/beanutils.html">Jakarta commons BeanUtils</a><br>q<br>name the Jakarta software that wraps a variety of logging API implementations.<br>a<br><a target=win2 href="http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs/jakarta-commons/logging/">Jakarta commons Logging</a><br>q<br><a target=win2 href="http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs/jakarta-commons-sandbox/workflow/">Jakarta Workflow</a><br>a<br>[a <font color=red>sandbox</font> project]<br>Workflow provides a framework for building workflow management systems.<br>q<br>what Jakarta s/w focuses on introspection and class manipulation?<br>a<br><a target=win2 href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/sandbox/clazz/">Jakarta sandbox Clazz</a><br>q<br><a target=win2 href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/jexl.html">Jakarta Jexl</a><br>a<br>Jakarta commons Jexl is an expression language which entends the Expression Language of the JSTL<br>by bringing in some of the lessons leaned by the<br><a target=win2 href="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/">Jakarta Velocity</a> community.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;jexl is a <font color=red>superset of the JSP, JSTL and JSF</font> expression languages<br>q<br>EJBDoclet<br>a<br>old name for XDoclet<br>q<br>Linux has good SMP support<br>a<br>on 2.2 kernel or later<br>q<br>methods which send a SOAPMessage<br>a<ul><li>ProviderConnection.send</li><li>SOAPConnection.call(request, new URLEndpoint("http://host/servlet"))</li><li>SOAPMessage.writeTo</li></ul>q<br><a target=win2 href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/digester.html">Jakarta Digester</a><br>a<br>Jakarta commons Digester is an XML-to-Java-object mapping utility commonly used for parsing XML configuration files.<br>q<br>what is the Jakarta software that provides object caching services?<br>a<br><a target=win2 href="http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs/jakarta-commons-sandbox/cache/">Jakarta sandbox Cache</a><br>q<br><a target=win2 href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/sandbox/threadpool/">Jakarta ThreadPool</a><br>a<br>[a <font color=red>sandbox</font> project]<br>ThreadPool is a simple component for asynchronously dispatching work to another thread in a pool for simple multi threaded programming.<br>q<br>can a task get executed more than one time<br>a<br>yes: although the initialization only occurs once, the task\'s execute() method may be called more than once, if the task is invoked more than once.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if target1 and target2 both depend on target3, then running \'ant target1 target2\' will run all tasks in target3 twice.<br>q<br>what Jakarta software encapsulates popular encoding/decoding algorithms?<br>a<br><a target=win2 href="http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs/jakarta-commons-sandbox/codec/">Jakarta sandbox Codec</a><br>q<br><a target=win2 href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/collections.html">Jakarta Collections</a><br>a<br>Jakarta commons Collections provides a suite of classes that<br>extend or augment the<br><a target=win2 href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/guide/collections/">Java Collections Framework</a>.<br>q<br>what is a s/w component which speeds performance by eliminating reliability-induced disk writes<br>a<br>The Rio File Cache: makes ordinary main memory safe for persistent storage by enabling memory to survive operating system crashes.

What do you think about the app and architecture? Is this what Java developers should be following?]<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;I don\'t think much of the Adventure Builder. Some things are good: the use of the JSTL, the use of unchecked exceptions for fatal data access exceptions, the use of J2SE 1.4 logging, and the fact that it doesn\'t use EJB unnecessarily.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are a lot of problems.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the web tier classes depend on facade classes, not interfaces. So it\'s impossible to change how business logic is implemented: for example, to introduce EJB if it were ever necessary.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;As I say in the book, I think web services protocols have the potential to displace proprietary protocols such as RMI. However, there\'s no good reason to use XML RPC in the Adventure Builder to contact the EJB tier. Again Sun have fallen into the trap of using a technology just because it\'s there, not because it makes sense for the supposed application.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;At a code level the Adventure Builder is very poor. There are virtually no comments, and many sloppy coding practices. There\'s a lot of cut and paste code. There are chains of if/else statements on hard-coded strings that could have been much better handled through an external mapping. Several classes lose stack traces when catching and rethrowing exceptions, although the Adventure Builder is written for J2EE (and hence J2SE) 1.4, which guarantees the ability to nest exceptions. The JDBC error handling is also broken; if an attempt to close a statement fails, the connection won\'t be closed. Overall it\'s a good advertisement for the kind of coding standards I present in Chapter 4 of the book. These go well beyond the Sun coding conventions, which are basically formatting and simple naming conventions.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;So I don\'t think J2EE developers are going to learn much from this new sample app. It\'s not realistic and it\'s not well implemented. Although it ignores a lot of real-world problems, it\'s unnecessarily complex for what it does.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;It\'s sad that Sun doesn\'t devote enough resources to creating a decent J2EE sample application. It is important, and Sun have people who could do a good job of it. Unfortunately the applications Sun produce look like they were knocked out quickly by people who had better things to do.<br>q<br>what is the Jakarta software that provides a very common set of utility classes that provide extra functionality for classes in java.lang?<br>a<br><a target=win2 href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/lang.html">Jakarta commons Lang</a><br>q<br>name the Jakarta collection of I/O utilities<br>a<br><a target=win2 href="http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs/jakarta-commons-sandbox/io/">Jakarta sandbox IO</a><br>q<br>name the Jakarta JAR Archive Repository<br>a<br><a target=win2 href="http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs/jakarta-commons-sandbox/jjar/">Jakarta sandbox JJar</a><br>q<br>name the Jakarta simple component for asynchronously dispatching work to another thread in a pool<br>for simple multi threaded programming.<br>a<br><a target=win2 href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/sandbox/threadpool/">Jakarta sandbox ThreadPool</a><br>q<br><a target=win2 href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/discovery/">Jakarta Discovery</a><br>a<br>Jakarta commons Discovery provides tools for locating resources (including classes)<br>by mapping service/reference names to resource names using a variety of schemes.<br>q<br><a target=win2 href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/cli/">Jakarta CLI</a><br>a<br>Jakarta commons CLI provides a simple API for working with Command Line arguments, options, option groups, mandatory options and so forth.<br>q<br>AutomatedCodeGeneration is...<br>a<br>...always based on the generating engine customizing templates with parameters.

Take CMT. Transactions can be modeled as an aspect. With AOP there\'s no need to use EJB to enjoy declarative transaction management.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;EJB offers a very limited form of AOP. Only a few aspects, such as transactions and security, can be managed by the container, and there\'s little flexibility in how these are managed. The fact that the container intercepts all method invocations on EJBs isn\'t fully leveraged. With AOP, we can potentially enjoy the benefits EJB currently provides without a heavyweight EJB container. And it opens up many more possibilities. With a widely adopted AOP infrastructure, we could have libraries of aspect interceptors, both application-specific and third party. Instead of accepting the baggage of an EJB container every time we want something like CMT, we could just chose those services we need. If EJB is a degustation menu where you get everything the chef prepared whether you want it or not, AOP is a la carte. I think in five years time we\'ll probably view EJB as a transitional technology towards true AOP.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;So I think the question is not whether AOP will impact J2EE, but what proves to be the dominant approach to implementing AOP. <font color=red>There\'s a choice between changing the language, as with AspectJ, and a standard Java approach, which uses dynamic proxies to add any number of "interceptors" around a method invocation.</font><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The <font color=red>dynamic proxy approach is less powerful than the custom language approach, but it\'s much easier to sell in an organization</font>, and I think it\'s powerful enough for the vast majority of real applications. Arguably AspectJ is too powerful, allowing the potential for buggy aspects to cause strange behavior across a system. There\'s currently a lot of work going on on the dynamic proxy approach. The Nanning project has already released code to Sourceforge. Rickard Oberg is working on his own implementation, and I\'ve also been doing some work, extending the framework that comes with the book to add AOP capabilities. <font color=red>JBoss 3</font> already uses an AOP-ish chain of "interceptors" around EJB invocations, and <font color=red>JBoss 4</font> is going to open that up in a more flexible way.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;q<br>sh: conditionally link some commands<br>a<br>make && make test && make install<br>&& in shell program is similar to Perl\'s &&.
