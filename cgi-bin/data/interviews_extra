'A' => 'in finance and accounting at ____ University. My past<br>experiences has been in retail and higher education.<br>Both aspects have prepared me well for this career.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;See also: <a href=\'http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/yourself.html\'>http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/yourself.html</a><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;2. What specific goals have you established for your career?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample excellent response:<br>My goals include becoming a Certified Financial Advisor<br>so I can obtain a better working knowledge of financial<br>research analysis, which would allow me contribute to my<br>client base as a better financial consultant since I would<br>have that extra insight into the companies they are seeking<br>to invest in. Also this is the foundation block to advancing<br>my career to portfolio manager or even branch office manager.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;See also: <a href=\'http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/thought.html\'>http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/thought.html</a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;3. What will it take to attain your goals, and what<br>steps have you taken toward attaining them?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample excellent response:<br>I\'ve already done some research on other workers<br>at Merrill Lynch to see how they achieved similar<br>goals. I know that Merrill Lynch encourages the<br>pursuit and will reimburse for tuition of a graduate<br>degree. I plan on pursuing a MBA to give me an even<br>more extensive knowledge of business and financial analysis.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;See also: <a href=\'http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/decision-making.html\'>http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/decision-making.html</a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;4. What some things are most important to you in your<br>ideal next job?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample excellent response<br>(equates ideal job with job he\'s interviewing for):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;My ideal job is one that incorporates both my education<br>and practical work skills to be the best I can be.<br>Namely combining my education in finance with my<br>working knowledge of customer service operations,<br>entrepreneurial abilities, computer skills, and<br>administrative skills. I want to utilize my analytical<br>expertise to help people meet their financial goals.<br>This is exactly why I am convinced that I would be a<br>very valuable member of the Merrill Lynch team.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;See also: <a href=\'http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/ideal.html\'>http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/ideal.html</a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;5. How do you determine or evaluate success?<br>Give me an example of one of your successful accomplishments.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample excellent response:<br>Last semester I was hired by by university\'s Council<br>for Student Activities. The group negotiates contracts of<br>entertainers, sets up sound equipment, markets the entertainers<br>to students, and generally decides what kind of programming<br>should be done. When I got hired, I didn\'t know the first<br>thing about how fill any of those responsibilities. I decided,<br>however, that I wasn\'t going to fail. Four months later,<br>I have become the Webmaster for the group. I also write<br>our campus newsletter and created Game Night, a student<br>competition of table games. That event yielded the biggest<br>audience ever for a non-concert event.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;6. What do you feel it would take to succeed in a company like ours?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample excellent response:<br>I believe successful salespeople put forth that<br>extra effort that turns potential clients into<br>first-time customers. Salespeople who attend to<br>the details by doing whatever it takes to win over<br>a prospective customer distinguish themselves from<br>the countless others who don\'t go to any extra effort.<br>Second, I think that if you label success as an attainable goal,<br>you will never consistently remain successful. You can<br>only succeed if you learn all there is to learn about<br>your product, your competitors, and personal selling.<br>Since this learning process is continuous, it\'s an<br>unattainable goal. With good reason, salespeople should<br>not consider success an attainable ending point but an<br>objective that will always linger slightly beyond their reach.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;See also: <a href=\'http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/company.html\'>http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/company.html</a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;7. How would you describe yourself in terms of your<br>ability to work as a member of a team?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample excellent response:<br>I have had many opportunities in both athletics and academics<br>to develop my skills as a team player. My tenure as a rower with<br>my college\'s crew team serves as a good example. I learned a great deal<br>about teamwork while rowing because all the rowers in the boat<br>must act as one, which meant that we incessantly worked to<br>keep each movement in the boat synchronized. On an individual<br>basis, we still worked toward group goals through weightlifting and<br>land-rowing. My experience as a marketing research team leader<br>also helped me to learn the role of "team player." I viewed my<br>position as that of group leader and of group member.<br>I ensured that everyone in the group had equal opportunity to contribute,<br>maintained excellent communication among group members,<br>and coordinated their energies toward reaching our team\'s goal.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;8. What short-term goals and objectives have<br>you established for yourself?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample excellent response:<br>My short-term goals are to graduate from<br>the Professional Development Program before<br>the standard two years and begin developing<br>a clientele. As an intern, I prepared ahead of<br>time by studying for the Series 7 and Series 64<br>exams that constitute a majority of a beginning<br>financial consultant\'s time. I\'d like to make<br>make the company that hires me wonder what it<br>ever did without me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;9. How would you evaluate your ability to deal<br>with conflict?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample excellent response:<br>Yes, working in retail and in the residence halls<br>required that I make many unpopular decisions at<br>times, whether it was terminating an associate or<br>taking judicial action on a resident. Often the person<br>in conflict with me would be upset and sometimes<br>physically outraged. I would always make sure that<br>I fully explained the situation, the policies behind<br>my decision, and why those policies exist. Usually by<br>the end of the conversation, the person could see the<br>other side of the situation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;10. Given the investment our company will make in<br>hiring and training you, can you give us a reason to hire you?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample excellent response:<br>I sincerely believe that I\'m the best<br>person for the job. I realize that there are many<br>other college students who have the ability to do<br>this job. I also have that ability. But I also<br>bring an additional quality that makes me the<br>very best person for the job--my attitude for<br>excellence. Not just giving lip service to<br>excellence, but putting every part of myself<br>into achieving it. In college and at my previous jobs,<br>I have consistently reached for becoming the very<br>best I can become. I think my leadership awards<br>from my college, and my management<br>positions are the result of possessing<br>the qualities you\'re looking for<br>in an employee.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;See also: <a href=\'http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/hire.html\'>http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/hire.html</a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;11. Describe what you\'ve accomplished toward reaching<br>a recent goal for yourself.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample excellent response:<br>My first few years in banking had me on the fast track<br>to branch management. I realized at some point along the<br>way that my true passion was in offering financial advice not<br>limited to checking accounts and loans. It was at that point<br>that I made the necessary arrangements to go back to school<br>full-time to pursue my goal, which I am just about to achieve.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;12. Can you describe your long-range goals and objectives?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample excellent response:<br>My primary objectives are to learn as much as possible<br>about your company\'s product offering, organizational structure,<br>and professional sales techniques so that I may become the most<br>productive member of your sales team.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;13. Tell me about a major problem you recently handled.<br>Were you successful in resolving it?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample excellent response:<br>While working at K-mart, I was one of three people to<br>work in the electronics department. One day upon arriving at work,<br>I was told the district manager was coming the next day to do<br>a store inspection. The two other people who worked in electronics<br>were both over 55. Neither could lift heavy objects, and one refused<br>to work at all. As a result, the electronics department was<br>usually left to me to keep stocked with product and kept in order.<br>I had about five hours of work time to get the entire department<br>in order. Those five hours passed around, and there was still<br>a substantial amount of work to be done. I asked the store manager<br>if I could stay and work after hours while the overnight stockers<br>were there. He said that because of the employment budget,<br>he could not let me. So I was faced with bringing the entire<br>store\'s rating down or not getting paid. I worked without pay,<br>and three hours later, the department was in tip-top shape. The<br>electronics department got a score of 95 out of 100.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;14. What plans do you have for continued study? An advanced degree?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample excellent response:<br>I plan to continue my education for the rest of my life. In<br>any technology-related field, keeping up to date through continuing<br>education is of the utmost importance. Continuing education can<br>include on-the-job training, courses sponsored by the employer,<br>and courses taken in new technologies as they emerge. I plan to<br>be not only a career employee but a career student so that I can<br>be the best information systems analyst I can be. I will ensure,<br>however, that any education I pursue not only doesn\'t interfere<br>with my job or the company\'s policies, but will enhance my value<br>as an employee.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;See also: <a href=\'http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/company.html\'>http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/company.html</a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;15. Describe the characteristics of a successful manager.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample excellent response:<br>A successful manager should have the vision and capabilities<br>to formulate strategies to reach his or her objectives and communicate<br>these ideas to his or her team members. In addition to serving<br>as a positive role model for co-workers, successful managers must also<br>be capable of inspiring others to recognize, develop,<br>and apply their talents to their utmost potential to reach a<br>common goal. These are the traits I hope to demonstrate when I\'m a<br>manager.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;See also: <a href=\'http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/manager.html\'>http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/manager.html</a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;16. Tell me what you know about our company.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample excellent example:<br>You\'re large and respected worldwide. You\'re both<br>a clinical and teaching hospital. Over the last 60 to<br>70 years you\'ve produced award-winning research.<br>In reviewing your Web site, I\'ve familiarized myself<br>with many of your corporate goals and objectives.<br>[Submitted by "Judy"]<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;See also: <a href=\'http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/company.html\'>http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/company.html</a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;17. Why do you think you might like to live in the community in which our company is located?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample excellent response:<br>Just a few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to spend several<br>days in your community, and I fell in love with it. I love the<br>fact that you have a thriving riverfront. I\'m impressed<br>with the many cultural opportunities here -- opera, theater,<br>art, and independent films. I\'ve also already become a<br>fan of the Saints and the other sports teams based here. I have<br>conducted significant Internet research on this city, so I<br>am quite comfortable with your location.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;18. Would it be a problem for you to relocate?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample excellent response:<br>I\'m open to opportunities within the company; if those<br>opportunities involve relocation, I would certainly consider it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;19. To what extent would you be willing to<br>travel for the job?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample excellent response:<br>Yes, I am more than willing to travel.<br>I understand the importance of going above<br>and beyond the call of duty to satisfy customer<br>requests is sometimes required and that Merrill Lynch\'s<br>customer focus belief means that travel is expected in<br>some circumstances. I am willing to make this commitment<br>to do whatever it takes to develop that long-term<br>relationship with a small business or client. It is only<br>through this relationship that loyalty can be maintained<br>and financial gains and growth can occur for both the<br>client and Merrill Lynch. It is my understanding from<br>other financial consultants that I have interviewed<br>at Merrill Lynch that this occurs maybe one or two times a month.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;20. Tell me about the salary range you\'re seeking.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample excellent response:<br>I am sure that I am the candidate you are looking for. If you<br>feel the same, the I\'m sure your offer will be fair and<br>commensurate with the value I can bring the company.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;See also: <a href=\'http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/money.html\'>http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/money.html</a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Want to keep abreast of interviewing trends, advice, and other<br>jobhunting topics:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; QuintZine &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Want to springboard your career?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QuintZine offers timely, topical tips<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for job-seekers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feature articles, links to great career sites,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q & As with experts, The Career Doctor. . . more!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free subscription:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\'http://www.quintcareers.com/QuintZine/subscribe.html\'>http://www.quintcareers.com/QuintZine/subscribe.html</a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Need help with a resume, cover letter or other<br>job-search correspondence?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br>RESUMES * JOB SEARCH CORRESPONDENCE<br>FROM TRUSTED EXPERTS * COVER LETTERS<br>Quintessential Resumes and Cover Letters<br>provides quality job-search correspondence at some of<br>the lowest prices on the Web.
