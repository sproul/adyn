<h3>A Proud Mother</h3>

At first I thought that I could not use this testimonial since it is from my mother.  But then I thought I would include it since it does mean something to me, in particular because it shows such a tremendous turnaround in attitude.  My mother has been my main native speaker reviewer for German, and she has been frequently demoralized by my egregious German grammatical errors; since this software has also made me no money -- despite two years of effort -- she has tactfully expressed concerns that the project will eventually destroy my marriage.  (Don't worry: Deirdre, my wife, has assured me that there is temporarily no danger of this.)

Nelson, my boy,
I have not been as excited about anything in a long time. Your
program is absolutely fantastic for somebody like me.  I am sooooo
impressed. You will do great with it, I am convinced. I will work 
on my Italian every day now because it is actually  f u n.

A proud mother.
