Nelson -- I'm in Rene Morel's French 4 class on Thursday evenings.  Thank
you for your presentation a couple of weeks ago.  Thank you also for
offering your program to the students of city college.

The program has been very helpful so far -- a very easy way to review french
and practice conjugations.  My only recommendation would be to add an
explanation of verb choice in certain cases.  For example, one of the
exercises is "I hear the traffic."  I would use J'ecoute la circulation, but
the answer dispayed used the verb entendre.  It would be helpful (at least
to me) to know if what the distinction between the two would be or if they
are both correct.  Aside from this minor point, I'm excited to continue
using the teacher program and firmly believe it will make a difference in my
studies.

Thanks again,
Michelle Dreher
