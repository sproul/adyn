<h2>Teacher Overview</h2>
The capacity of short-term memory to absorb new information is limited, and so a key to maximizing learning is to limit the set of material being considered at a given moment.  When working with flashcards -- whether conventional or in software -- one accomplishes this by leaving most of the cards in the box (or on the website), grabbing a manageable pile to master onto your table (or onto your PC).  One might further select an even smaller group of cards with the most difficult exercises in one's hands.  Teacher organizes the exercises, or flashcards, along these same lines.  The student moves flashcards between his "hands" and the "table" by using the <!--link setButtons flashcard set buttons--><a href=../teacher/teacher.html#setButtons>flashcard set buttons</a>.
<p>
Though this product is essentially a software version of flash cards, there are some important differences and improvements which make it a much more effective teaching tool:
<ul>
<li>
Teacher's translation exercises are in terms of sentences, not words.  This is because the human mind naturally learns language in terms of phrases and sentences with context, not words memorized in isolation.
</li>
<li>
The tool automatically tracks students' progress in various topics, and so is able to adapt the selection of flashcards to fit students' individual needs.
</li>
<li>
The tool remembers from day to day and from week to week what flashcards individual students have struggled with, and so can modify the courses of study to reflect this memory.
</li>
<li>
The tool allows users to explicitly specify topics for emphasis.
</li>
<li>
The tool provides grammatical notes explaining special cases and grammar rules relevant to each flashcard.
</li>
<li>
The tool's flashcards are cross linked with an online grammar explaining the grammatical principles covered.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
As foreign language students pursue their studies, they will find that there are specific areas where they struggle which vary by the individual.  Ideally a successful learning system will focus a student on those areas where he is weakest.  To achieve this, this system categorizes all flashcards according to what areas of knowledge they cover, and then tracks the performance of the student across these categories.  In this way the student's weaknesses can be identified and then attacked by emphasizing flashcards which cover those weak points.  The student's strength in any area is continually measured and updated to allow the system to intelligently recognize his progress and adjust its reckoning of the student's relative weaknesses.  So for example, if a French student has problems with translations requiring use of the subjunctive case, the system should recognize this weakness and select an increasing proportion of flashcards which involve subjunctive usages.
