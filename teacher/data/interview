'A' => 'My background to date has been centered around preparing myself to become the very best financial consultant I can become. Let me tell you specifically how I\'ve prepared myself. I am an undergraduate student in finance and accounting at ____ University. My past experiences has been in retail and higher education. Both aspects have prepared me well for this career.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;See also: <a href=\'http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/yourself.html\'>http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/yourself.html</a><br>q<br>2. What specific goals have you established for your career?<br>a<br>My goals include becoming a Certified Financial Advisor so I can obtain a better working knowledge of financial research analysis, which would allow me contribute to my client base as a better financial consultant since I would have that extra insight into the companies they are seeking to invest in. Also this is the foundation block to advancing my career to portfolio manager or even branch office manager.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;See also: <a href=\'http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/thought.html\'>http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/thought.html</a><br>q<br>3. What will it take to attain your goals, and what<br>a<br>sSample excellent response: I\'ve already done some research on other workers at Merrill Lynch to see how they achieved similar goals. I know that Merrill Lynch encourages the pursuit and will reimburse for tuition of a graduate degree. I plan on pursuing a MBA to give me an even more extensive knowledge of business and financial analysis.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;See also: <a href=\'http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/decision-making.html\'>http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/decision-making.html</a><br>q<br>4. What some things are most important to you in your<br>a<br>iSample excellent response (equates ideal job with job he\'s interviewing for): My ideal job is one that incorporates both my education and practical work skills to be the best I can be. Namely combining my education in finance with my working knowledge of customer service operations, entrepreneurial abilities, computer skills, and administrative skills. I want to utilize my analytical expertise to help people meet their financial goals. This is exactly why I am convinced that I would be a very valuable member of the Merrill Lynch team.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;See also: <a href=\'http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/ideal.html\'>http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/ideal.html</a><br>q<br>5. How do you determine or evaluate success?<br>a<br>GSample excellent response: Last semester I was hired by by university\'s Council for<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Student Activities. The group negotiates contracts of entertainers, sets up sound equipment, markets the entertainers to students, and generally decides what kind of programming should be done. When I got hired, I didn\'t know the first thing about how fill any of those responsibilities. I decided, however, that I wasn\'t going to fail. Four months later, I have become the Webmaster for the group. I also write our campus newsletter and created Game Night, a student competition of table games. That event yielded the biggest audience ever for a non-concert event.<br>q<br>6. What do you feel it would take to succeed in a company like ours?<br>a<br>I believe successful salespeople put forth that extra effort that turns potential clients into first-time customers. Salespeople who attend to the details by doing whatever it takes to win over a prospective customer distinguish themselves from the countless others who don\'t go to any extra effort. Second, I think that if you label success as an attainable goal, you will never consistently remain successful. You can only succeed if you learn all there is to learn about your product, your competitors, and personal selling. Since this learning process is continuous, it\'s an unattainable goal. With good reason, salespeople should not consider success an attainable ending point but an objective that will always linger slightly beyond their reach.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;See also: <a href=\'http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/company.html\'>http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/company.html</a><br>q<br>7. How would you describe yourself in terms of your<br>a<br>a<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample excellent response: I have had many opportunities in both athletics and academics to develop my skills as a team player. My tenure as a rower with my college\'s crew team serves as a good example. I learned a great deal about teamwork while rowing because all the rowers in the boat must act as one, which meant that we incessantly worked to keep each movement in the boat synchronized. On an individual basis, we still worked toward group goals through weightlifting and land-rowing. My experience as a marketing research team leader also helped me to learn the role of "team player." I viewed my position as that of group leader and of group member.I ensured that everyone in the group had equal opportunity to contribute, maintained excellent communication among group members, and coordinated their energies toward reaching our team\'s goal.<br>q<br>8. What short-term goals and objectives have<br>a<br>ySample excellent response: My short-term goals are to graduate from the Professional Development Program before the standard two years and begin developing a clientele. As an intern, I prepared ahead of time by studying for the Series 7 and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Series 64 exams that constitute a majority of a beginning financial consultant\'s time. I\'d like to make make the company that hires me wonder what it ever did without me.<br>q<br>9. How would you evaluate your ability to deal<br>a<br>w<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample excellent response: Yes, working in retail and in the residence halls required that I make many unpopular decisions at times, whether it was terminating an associate or taking judicial action on a resident. Often the person in conflict with me would be upset and sometimes physically outraged. I would always make sure that I fully explained the situation, the policies behind my decision, and why those policies exist. Usually by the end of the conversation, the person could see the other side of the situation.<br>q<br>10. Given the investment our company will make in<br>a<br>hSample excellent response: I sincerely believe that I\'m the best person for the job. I realize that there are many other college students who have the ability to do this job. I also have that ability. But I also bring an additional quality that makes me the very best person for the job--my attitude for excellence. Not just giving lip service to excellence, but putting every part of myself into achieving it. In college and at my previous jobs, I have consistently reached for becoming the very best I can become. I think my leadership awards from my college, and my management positions are the result of possessing the qualities you\'re looking for in an employee.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;See also: <a href=\'http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/hire.html\'>http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/hire.html</a><br>q<br>11. Describe what you\'ve accomplished toward reaching<br>a<br>a<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample excellent response: My first few years in banking had me on the fast track to branch management. I realized at some point along the way that my true passion was in offering financial advice not limited to checking accounts and loans. It was at that point that I made the necessary arrangements to go back to school full-time to pursue my goal, which I am just about to achieve.<br>q<br>12. Can you describe your long-range goals and objectives?<br>a<br>My primary objectives are to learn as much as possible about your company\'s product offering, organizational structure, and professional sales techniques so that I may become the most productive member of your sales team.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;q<br>13. Tell me about a major problem you recently handled.<br>a<br>WSample excellent response: While working at K-mart, I was one of three people to work in the electronics department. One day upon arriving at work, I was told the district manager was coming the next day to do a store inspection. The two other people who worked in electronics were both over 55. Neither could lift heavy objects, and one refused to work at all. As a result, the electronics department was usually left to me to keep stocked with product and kept in order.I had about five hours of work time to get the entire department in order. Those five hours passed around, and there was still a substantial amount of work to be done. I asked the store manager if I could stay and work after hours while the overnight stockers were there. He said that because of the employment budget, he could not let me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;So I was faced with bringing the entire store\'s rating down or not getting paid. I worked without pay, and three hours later, the department was in tip-top shape. The electronics department got a score of 95 out of 100.<br>q<br>14. What plans do you have for continued study? An advanced degree?<br>a<br>I plan to continue my education for the rest of my life. In any technology-related field, keeping up to date through continuing education is of the utmost importance. Continuing education can include on-the-job training, courses sponsored by the employer, and courses taken in new technologies as they emerge. I plan to be not only a career employee but a career student so that I can be the best information systems analyst I can be. I will ensure, however, that any education I pursue not only doesn\'t interfere with my job or the company\'s policies, but will enhance my value as an employee.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;See also: <a href=\'http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/company.html\'>http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/company.html</a><br>q<br>15. Describe the characteristics of a successful manager.<br>a<br>A successful manager should have the vision and capabilities to formulate strategies to reach his or her objectives and communicate these ideas to his or her team members. In addition to serving as a positive role model for co-workers, successful managers must also be capable of inspiring others to recognize, develop, and apply their talents to their utmost potential to reach a common goal. These are the traits I hope to demonstrate when I\'m a manager.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;See also: <a href=\'http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/manager.html\'>http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/manager.html</a><br>q<br>16. Tell me what you know about our company.<br>a<br>You\'re large and respected worldwide. You\'re both a clinical and teaching hospital. Over the last 60 to 70 years you\'ve produced award-winning research. In reviewing your Web site, I\'ve familiarized myself with many of your corporate goals and objectives.[Submitted by "Judy"]<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;See also: <a href=\'http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/company.html\'>http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/company.html</a><br>q<br>17. Why do you think you might like to live in the community in which our company is located?<br>a<br>Just a few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to spend several days in your community, and I fell in love with it. I love the fact that you have a thriving riverfront. I\'m impressed with the many cultural opportunities here -- opera, theater, art, and independent films. I\'ve also already become a fan of the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Saints and the other sports teams based here. I have conducted significant Internet research on this city, so I am quite comfortable with your location.<br>q<br>18. Would it be a problem for you to relocate?<br>a<br>I\'m open to opportunities within the company; if those opportunities involve relocation, I would certainly consider it.<br>q<br>19. To what extent would you be willing to<br>a<br>t<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample excellent response: Yes, I am more than willing to travel.I understand the importance of going above and beyond the call of duty to satisfy customer requests is sometimes required and that Merrill Lynch\'s customer focus belief means that travel is expected in some circumstances. I am willing to make this commitment to do whatever it takes to develop that long-term relationship with a small business or client. It is only through this relationship that loyalty can be maintained and financial gains and growth can occur for both the client and Merrill Lynch. It is my understanding from other financial consultants that I have interviewed at Merrill Lynch that this occurs maybe one or two times a month.<br>q<br>20. Tell me about the salary range you\'re seeking.<br>a<br>I am sure that I am the candidate you are looking for. If you feel the same, the I\'m sure your offer will be fair and commensurate with the value I can bring the company.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;See also: <a href=\'http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/money.html\'>http://www.quintcareers.com/job_interviews/money.html</a><br>q<br>Tell me about the last time you\'ve been in conflict w/ a peer, and how you handled it.<br>a<br>There was an engineer at Sybase who was reporting to me for some time, and she was very slow -- which I didn\'t mind so<br>much, but what would happen is that she would project a date for completing a task, and then the work would not get<br>done __and__ she would not communicate to me that the date was slipping. And so I ended up having to go to her fairly<br>frequently to extract the current status -- something that I don\'t think she really enjoyed, and I definitely didn\'t<br>want to do it, but I didn\'t know how else to keep on top of where the project was.<br>q<br>How do you handle the situation where you know a better way to go in a design, and yet a different method is favored?<br>Give me an example of the situation above.<br>a<br>I think that when a team is putting together a design, there is a time when various alternatives will be debated, and<br>at that point, if the general thinking is not going your way, I think it is just important to try to make sure that if<br>you are outvoted, it is not because people don\'t understands what it is that you think, but it\'s just a difference of<br>opinion. Eventually, a design will be settled on, and at that point I think it\'s everyone\'s mission to make the best<br>possible effort to make it work.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;At Sybase, our nightly build and test runs were failing on certain platforms because their network connectivity was not<br>reliable. I argued in favor of maintaining separate copies of the code lines on those platforms in order to reduce the<br>dependence on the network, but the general consensus was that this approached did not solve the real problem, which was<br>the shaky network connections. But my thinking was that we had no idea why these platforms were suffering the failures<br>that they were, and because the system and network administrators were heavily overworked they probably also were not<br>capable of putting in the time and research to get to the bottom of the problem, and so just as a practical matter<br>these problems were probably not going to be solved in the short term. So initially I lost this argument, and an<br>effort was made to put pressure on the network administrators to figure out what was wrong. They did try, but they<br>were not able to solve the problem, and eventually the steady flow of failures brought people around to my point of<br>view.<br>q<br>Problem Solving: When was the last time you solved a difficult problem that would have significant impact? What was the<br>situation? How did you go about analyzing the problem? What additional information did you gather? What alternative<br>solutions did you consider? Tell me how you implemented your solution. What was the outcome?<br>a<br>At extensity we realized that there was a dependency on the client side for our Internet Explorer users on using a<br>particular JVM build. Failure to use this JVM was resulting in the application hanging, and this was leading to a lot<br>of support calls. It wasn\'t clear how to detect which JVM was installed from Java but I poked around the Microsoft web<br>site and figured out a Microsoft proprietary method for determining the build number. I ended up writing an applet<br>which used inspection to determine if the JVM was equipped with the Microsoft methods, and if it was, calling them. If<br>the wrong JVM was in place, I had a JavaScript wrapper which would take the user to a page explaining that situation<br>and offering to download and install the correct JVM.<br>q<br>What\'s one of the hardest decisions you\'ve ever had to make?<br>Decision Making: What was the most difficult decision you have made in the last six months? What was the situation?<br>What made it difficult? What factors or variables did you consider? What did you decide? What was the result?<br>a<br>Going back a little that further, last fall, after I had been working on my own product for several months, extensity<br>called me and offered me additional contract work. I was very tempted to say yes because it is certainly an<br>uncomfortable feeling to not be earning any money, yet I knew that if I took on contract work from them, this new<br>responsibility would probably be sufficiently absorbing that it would not be possible to make significant progress on<br>my educational software. On the other hand, I was at this time engaged to be married, and my fiance was urging me to<br>take it in order to have the additional security. I ended up deciding not to take advantage of this offer, and instead<br>to continue with my work. The result was that the educational software has been completed, and is currently in beta.<br>I think I need some more time to know whether that was a good decision or not, however. If I make no money with the<br>product, I will have had the satisfaction of creating a fine piece of software, but I will have foregone significant<br>earnings in order to achieve this result. I\'m not sure which is more important.<br>q<br>Achievement /Drive: Describe a situation in which you believe you were effective in achieving an aggressive goal. What<br>caused you to work hard to meet this objective? What methods or skills did you use to meet your goal? What were the<br>results? What feedback did you receive?<br>a<br>TRW archiving program controlling hard drives: performance goal.<br>q<br>Handling Details: Tell me about the most significant project you have worked on in which it was crucial to keep track<br>of details while still managing the “big picture.” What was the project? What skills did you utilize in managing<br>it? How did you make sure the work got done? How did you keep focused on the overall goal of the project while still<br>managing all of the specific parts? How did the project turn out? What feedback did you receive on your management of<br>the task?<br>a<ul><li>qa details for web kbd, teacher. browser compatibility.</li><li>At Sybase I was asked to get the build and test under control for the connectivity division. There was a steady flow of high priority minor requests which needed to be satisfied immediately, but there was also a larger problem which needed to be solved which was the general lack of automated infrastructure to support a reliable nightly build and test. Because the job was extremely subject to interruptions, I found it necessary to record every request, even really trivial ones, in order to assure myself that they were all being satisfied. So I ended up with a system of checklists along with numerical priorities to make sure that the most crucial items, especially ones which didn\'t take very long, would be satisfied first. In order to attack the larger problem of a lack of automated infrastructure, I worked evenings and weekends to put into place a system of scripts which facilitated the process and its automatic analysis. Management was supportive of me in all instances of this job, and the feedback was very positive once the automated infrastructure was up and running.</li></ul>q<br>Oral Communication: Describe a time when you had great difficulty communicating your thoughts clearly to another person or group. What was the situation? What message were you trying to convey? Where did the difficulty in communicating effectively lie? What did you do to get your point across more clearly? What was the outcome?<br>a<br>once I had trouble expressing a design issue to a co-worker. I think the main problem was that she was not a native English speaker. My usual method is to just slow down, and -- without being condescending -- try to express things really simply. But this wasn\'t working either, and I found that what did work was to get a couple of other people involved in the conversation. With more people came more ways of expressing the same information, and I think that made it easier to understand.<br>q<br>Conflict Management: Tell me about a time when you voiced a concern or disagreement to a co-worker, supervisor, or professor. Where did the disagreement originate? What did you say to the other person? What was his/her reaction? What was the outcome of the disagreement? Give an example of when you had to work with someone who was difficult to get along with. Why was this person difficult? How did you handle that person?<br>a<br>Sanitized version of Chris and me: when I was assigned to help out with an extensity project, I encountered some serious build problems which were due to a co-worker apparently not checking in all elements of his solution. I went to him and he flatly denied that this was the case. I checked my work and verified that it was the case and we revisited the situation, and he still denied it. I changed tack and encouraged him to use a tool that I had written for detecting modified modules which had not been checked back into the central repository, and eventually he did install on his machine, and this did reveal the modules which were missing; with the problem explicitly revealed, he finally realized what the situation was, and checked in the missing modules. I eventually convinced a number of people to use this tool, which eliminated the need for error prone independent recordkeeping of what modules had been modified.<br>q<br>Coordinating/Leading Others: Tell me about a situation in which you had to coordinate several people to achieve a goal. What prompted you to take the lead? How did you go about coordinating and leading the group? How did they respond? What tools did you use to measure the progress of the group? What was the outcome?<br>a<br>At TRW I was part of a team of engineers prototyping in preparation for a bid to automate certain IRS processes. Because of my strong knowledge of win32, I ended up being a de facto lead for technical questions.<br>q<br>Managing Stress: Describe your most disappointing experience. How did you cope with it? What did you do to move beyond it?<br>a<br>At TRW it was very disappointing to see the IRS project bid fail. But once it was clear that this was the outcome, we got together the members of the team to analyze our work and see if there had been anything that we could have been to have achieved a different outcome. The general feeling was that the project had fallen through for business reasons --that is, it was a little bit too all-encompassing, yet its technical achievements were sound. The upshot was that we worked to at least preserve and document the technical achievements of the project for future use by similar projects within TRW.<br>q<br>Describe a situation in which you were able to use persuasion to successfully convince someone to see things your way.<br>a<br>cnf approval.<br>q<br>What steps do you follow to study a problem before making a decision?<br>a<br>first: can it be broken down into component problems which are better understood?<br>this depends on several factors:<br>is it possible to reverse the decision?<br>Will getting the question wrong have serious consequences (e.g., customers would be affected, deadlines would slip,<br>etc.)<br>am I well-informed in the topic?<br>Are my co-workers well-informed in the topic?<br>how big is the topic? Is it a huge body of knowledge which requires lengthy study? Or is it a relatively simple<br>question which can be referred to an expert?<br>Depending on the answers to these questions, I use the following methods to get information:<br>online search<br>consult with co-workers/friends<br>buy books and study them<br>q<br>Describe a very stressful experience and how you dealt with it.<br>Describe an instance when you had to think on your feet to extricate yourself from a difficult situation.<br>Describe the most significant or creative presentation which you have had to complete.<br>a<br>At extensity, one of my co-workers was going to lead a class given in San Francisco for extensity developers. The<br>class was $500 for the day, and had attracted extensity developers from around the country. My co-worker asked me if I<br>could come also can be a technical backup. I agreed to that. My co-worker ended up being very busy in today\'s leading<br>up to the class, and so did not have time to do any preparation for it. I think he may have been pretty stressed about<br>it, and when the day arrived, he had a horrible back problem which made him not want to come. So he called me at 630<br>in the morning and asked me how I felt about leading the class alone. Since I had only been scheduled to be a backup<br>resource for difficult questions, I also had not done any special preparation. But I told him I would do my best. So<br>I went into the learning Center, where the students were each equipped with a PC and an extra monitor to display the<br>fine teaching materials which the instructor would surely be bringing. I brought my laptop, but then there were some<br>problems connecting it to the classroom LAN, and so even that was not initially available. While the local network<br>administrator worked on my laptop, the class started and I just lectured about the general programming environment<br>working with extensity. I was very stressed, but there was certainly a lot to talk about and so I was able to proceed.<br>For the afternoon we were scheduled to do a lab of extensity problem solving in the J++ environment. I was familiar<br>with using J++ as a debugger, but since Microsoft projects are not used at extensity, I was not familiar with how to<br>build a J++ project and make it work with the extensity environment, which inherently went against some Microsoft<br>projects conventions. But during lunch I was able to figure out how to do it and then was able to lead the lab in the<br>afternoon as anticipated. I wouldn\'t say that it was a completely smooth performance, but we were able to do some<br>exercises and the class seemed pleased with the result.<br>q<br>What was the most complex assignment you have had?

We had a lengthy exchange by e-mail, but only by actually visiting<br>him and stepping him through the fix\' installation where we able to straighten everything out.

I chose a combination of Perl and Java to be the platform for this<br>software and the basis for my choice was that it would make the implementation and also the administration once the<br>product was running very simple. What I didn\'t think about was the fact that this style of software does not match the<br>requirements that many software resellers have for packages that they will market. The most common arrangement is that<br>software comes in a stand-alone bundle with no dependency on the Web or the availability of particular software on an<br>ISPs. Meanwhile my software as currently implemented only works over the Web. My approach in choosing the<br>architecture that I did made the implementation and beta testing relatively painless, but didn\'t give enough weight to<br>the longer-term business needs -- that is, my hope that the product would eventually turn a profit. So this has been<br>an important lesson for me to think through the implications of such fundamental choices down the line.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;q<br>How does the process of writing code for internal customers differ from that of writing software for an external<br>a<br>market?<br>When you are writing software for internal consumption, you will typically know exactly who the audience is, and so it<br>is possible to engage those people from the earliest stage. When you are writing for an external market, on the other<br>hand, although you can do research to hypothesize what the market wants, I think it is a very difficult problem to<br>determine with confidence what are the important features. One way to go is to focus on existing customers, assuming<br>that they will approximate the larger market, but of course there is always the possibility that there is some large<br>market segment which is completely distinct from the population of existing customers, and could make a new product<br>very successful.<br>q<br>Which language is best, perl or Java?<br>a<br>This depends on the task at hand. If I needed to build a simple parser, I would probably prefer perl because it\'s<br>regular expression language is so convenient to use for that purpose. Although logically equivalent packages exist for<br>Java, their use is much wordier. If I needed to provide distributed functionality, then the path of least work might<br>be to write an EJB.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;q<br>Describe your design process for teacher, browser spinach, and Web keyboard.<br>a<br>Use cases.<ul><li>Data structures.</li><li>Simplest possible functional framework.</li><li>Fleshed out, with focus on the areas which were the riskiest.</li><li>For teacher, I was concerned about the performance issues coming from maintaining the user database on the server.</li><li>For bs and wk, I was concerned about how to cope with poorly formed HTML.</li></ul>q<br>What are the attributes of a good leader? communication and initiative<br>Do you consider yourself a leader?<br>Give a concrete example of leadership that you showed in a project.<br>a<br>Since I have only very rarely had engineers under me, I think the way I have generally shown leadership in my various<br>projects has been by my initiative in making proposals to solve problems and then implementing them.

I adjusted the protocol to make it lighter weight, and more<br>importantly, mood responsibility for propagating the data to the server to a background thread which would not hurt the<br>perceived performance.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;q<br>Tell me about yourself/what are your strengths?<br>How would you describe yourself?<br>a<br>[also a good answer to "What do you think it takes to be successful in a company like ours?"]<br><p><br>My main strength is that I am very productive, my work is very clean; and<br>I\'m a very fast learner -- I\'m able to pick up and understand new areas<br>really quickly; and I guess the bottom line is that I do what needs to be<br>done to get the results we want. For most of the projects that I have<br>worked on there have been at least occasional crunches. But when that<br>happens, I step up my efforts in order to meet my obligations, whether<br>that means working on weekends or late at night. In one of my jobs, I<br>averaged 60 hour weeks for over a year. The way I see it, this is not an<br>ideal lifestyle, but I\'m willing to do whatever needs to be done to<br>accomplish our goals. [Tell me more about this situation where you worked<br>60 hours a week. Why was that necessary?] This was when I was working<br>for Sybase; I was asked to handle the code line administration and build<br>responsibilities for the connectivity division. The thing with this job<br>was that there was a moment-by-moment had the flow of requests that had to<br>be satisfied right away, but also a huge need for work on the software<br>infrastructure in order to automate a lot of the processes. This position<br>had been left to pretty junior people who weren\'t capable of seeing the<br>big picture and figuring out how the work could be reorganized to make it<br>a low bit more manageable. We had very recently taken on a bunch of new<br>platforms and the lack of a reliable build and has infrastructure and only<br>just become perceived as a significant problem. So I took on the<br>responsibility to deal with this and it was a very intense job because<br>during the day there were constant requests that needed to be satisfied<br>immediately, and so the way it worked, I ended up doing what I needed to<br>do to satisfy those requests, and then working late to develop the<br>software required to automate the builds and the maintenance of our code<br>lines on the various platforms. This ended up being a lengthy battle, but<br>the eventual results were very gratifying.<br><p><br>[Other examples?]<br><p><br>At Extensity it was a fairly constant theme that I was brought in to help<br>with projects that were in trouble. Here the problem was that we had a<br>product which was very complex and fragile, and also just the role of the<br>group lent itself to high-pressure: we were in direct contact with<br>customers whose processes were very dependent on what we could do for<br>them. And it didn\'t help that the product was very expensive, and so<br>customers\' expectations were generally pretty high.<br>q<br>Examples of quick, independent learning:<br>a<br>I know I told you that I\'m a quick learner, but I would like to say just<br>a little bit more about that. A large proportion of what I know about<br>this field comes from buying the books and studying them all the way<br>through, and then applying this knowledge. I think when facing a new<br>technology, there is an initial time which is not very fun where one<br>doesn\'t know the area well enough to always be aware of the various<br>alternatives, and where it really pays to go through the pain of<br>thoroughly studying the references and code in order to understand the<br>environment in depth. So for me, I\'ve gone through this stage of study in<br>learning the internals and system interfaces of all the operating systems<br>I\'ve worked with, and most recently I\'ve been doing this with Java and the<br>various classes supporting J2EE.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;q<br>What are your weaknesses?<br>a<br>I need to get stronger in j2ee.<br>I feel shy as a public speaker, and that may be helpful for my own products....@@<br>@@I really cannot think of any weaknesses which would prevent me from being<br>very effective as a software implementer.<br>q<br>Why do you prefer to be a contractor instead of a full-time employee?<br>a<br>I think in general the trade-off is between higher compensation and<br>security. (And of course, stock, although people don\'t seem to care about<br>that so much anymore.) I don\'t care so much about security because,<br>although the current job market is not good, I don\'t worry about getting<br>more work. I\'ve been very productive in all of my jobs, so the way I see<br>it, I\'ll always be able to get work from people who have worked with me<br>before even when the job market is pretty grim overall, the way it is now.<br>q<br>Do you know anything about CORBA?<br>a<br>Although I don\'t have any CORBA projects in my work history, I actually am<br>very familiar with CORBA, and I think I would quickly be productive in<br>CORBA projects. When I was at Sybase, there was a lot of talk about using<br>CORBA for various purposes, and I thought there was a good chance that I<br>was going to get some heavy CORBA assignments. So at that time I studied<br>the architecture and the various services, and got to a decent level of<br>understanding. As it turned out, the CORBA assignments never materialized<br>-- and so I don\'t claim CORBA expertise, but I definitely understand how<br>that system works and I think I would be up to speed right away.<br>q<br>Which do you prefer, working alone or in a team?<br>Can you relate your answer to concrete examples in your work history?<br>a<br>When you work in a team, you are able to brainstorm and work together to<br>overcome problems, and this can be a powerful thing. However, the more<br>people who are involved, the more overhead you have coordinating between<br>them. So I think there is a trade-off which has to be judged according to<br>the nature of the problem being solved. If we\'re talking about a simple,<br>well understood problem, then I would prefer to work alone and just get it<br>done immediately. But if the problem is complex and not well understood,<br>then I think working together can result in fewer mistakes and<br>misunderstandings. I think this is especially true in situations where<br>the requirements are in flux, and there\'s a significant risk of doing work<br>which isn\'t going to match what is wanted by the end of the project. Then<br>I think working closely together can lead to really big savings in time<br>and effort.<br><p><br>Sure -- in my work at Extensity where I was integrating<br>customers\' accounting systems with our product, the work was very<br>dependent on exactly satisfying the customer\'s requirements, and often<br>these requirements were not specified very well. This was definitely a<br>case where, although the work was not necessarily that complex, since we<br>did not have great knowledge or familiarity with the customer\'s specific<br>systems, there was a big risk of implementing software which would not<br>conform to the customer\'s environment. So in this type of situation, I<br>thought it was extremely beneficial to keeping close contact with the<br>customer, always making sure that we were on the same page. When I was<br>working with AirTouch, I frequently integrated my software with my<br>counterpart\'s system, meaning that we had a fairly constant sanity check<br>on what we were doing; I was never in a situation where I was doing lots<br>of work which he hadn\'t seen yet, and so we could be pretty confident that<br>we were progressing toward our goal. The result in this project was that<br>we were able to make everything work without any significant missteps.<br>And an example of where working alone was beneficial: when I was<br>at Aion I wrote the database integration for the product. Although the<br>task involved lots of code and was fairly complex, I did the work with no<br>specification and no written design or review before the work was done.<br>Normally I would not be that comfortable with such a situation, but here<br>the problem was very well understood -- I knew what the interface was<br>going to be on our product\'s side, and it was just a question of making<br>the product work with all kinds of SQL data, and implementing it in clean,<br>documented code which would be easy to maintain. I knew exactly how to do<br>this, and not needing to coordinate with anyone else on the work made it<br>go a lot faster.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;q<br>Which do you prefer, working in the office, or off-site?<br>a<br>This answer should be related to the question about working in teams vs.<br>working alone. If the work requires working in teams, then being on-site<br>is a big advantage. If it doesn\'t, then working off-site can be good<br>since it saves the commute time and can result in a work environment with<br>fewer distractions.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;q<br>Summarize your experience with J2EE.<br>a<br>Extensity\'s server products work with Web logic, so deploying or<br>configuring Extensity\'s product always involves setting up and configuring<br>Web logic; however, as an engineer deploying the product for individual<br>customers, my focus as a programmer was always on the custom programming<br>elements I was working with to interface between our product and the<br>customer\'s accounting and other packages. So we did use JDBC through Web<br>logic to update customer databases... I would not say that my experience<br>programming J2EE classes is very heavy, but I am very familiar with the<br>architecture and capabilities of J2EE, and I think that I will very<br>quickly be an effective programmer in a J2EE environment, just judging<br>from my experience coming up to speed in other complex environments in the<br>past. So for example, at my white light job, I needed to learn ODBC and a<br>very large set of C++ classes called ACE, as well as the Rogue Wave<br>packages, and I was effective almost immediately. At Extensity probably<br>the biggest hurdle was becoming familiar with the internal architecture of<br>Extensity\'s products, and learning how to get things done in that<br>environment, and there also I was very productive at an early date.<br>q<br>How strong are you in Java?<br>a<br>I feel very strong. I definitely feel in my element when I\'m programming<br>Java. I would say that this is my favorite programming language because<br>it elegantly supports implementing object-oriented solutions, so it gives<br>you lots of power, but it also is a very safe language. Not having to<br>directly manage memory except by not leaving unnecessary references hang<br>around is a real boon for a programmer. And the Java community is so<br>large and prolific, it seems to me that it is a very frequent occurrence<br>that a publicly available class will already exist which can solve<br>whenever the problem of the moment may be.<br>q<br>What programming environments have you used for Java?<br>a<br>For debug I used J++, but for development I relied on emacs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;q<br>Describe a change in design that you originated based on your knowledge of business.<br>a<br>I was assigned to write a back end reporting function for extensity\'s expense reports application for a particular<br>customer, and I knew from my work with the customer\'s front end rules that it was prohibited for certain expense types<br>to not use the company credit card, and yet I saw that on the back end there was no control to stop that kind of usage.<br>I think maybe the original thinking was that since the front-end in force the prohibition, that we would be safe and<br>not checking for it in the back end, but in fact there were various facilities for importing expenses which bypassed<br>the GUI, so I thought this represented a vulnerability to the system. So I proposed and implemented checks on the back<br>end to fill this gap.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;qWhy did you leave your last job?<br>a<br>Well, I was working on a short-term contract which was renewed over 2 1/2 years, and the company was very happy with my<br>work, but as their business began to suffer, they eliminated all of their contractors as an economy move. In fact I<br>was retained for a number of months after all of the other contractors were dismissed, but eventually my turn came too,<br>over the objections of my immediate supervisors.<br><p><br>As for my work with Adynware, after working on the educational software package for a year, the software is now and<br>data and does not require a full-time effort. So it this point I\'m underemployed and ready for new work.<br>q<br>What are your long range and short range goals and objectives?<br>a<br>I\'m very happy working as a software engineer, and I don\'t particularly of aspire to, for example, become a manager. I<br>think the various technologies that we work with our advancing so fast that I really can\'t see getting bored with this<br>work. I just want to keep learning new things and keep refining my techniques in order to become more effective and<br>more productive.<br>q<br>What specific goals other than those related to your occupation, have you established for yourself for the next ten<br>years?<br>a<br>I\'m very interested in foreign languages and I hope to be fluent in Spanish and Italian, and possibly German in another<br>decade. I\'m studying those languages with my own educational software and by reading children\'s books and watching<br>foreign news.<br>q<br>What do you see yourself doing five years from now? Ten years from now?<br>a<br>I hope to be in the same profession, but just 5/10 years stronger and more effective than I am now. I think I am a<br>strong engineer now, but one can always improve, and it is my hope that I will do so.<br>q<br>What do you really want to do in life?<br>a<br>I want to be a good father and husband and provide a secure and safe environment for my family. Beyond that, I hope<br>that my wife and I can achieve a lifestyle where it is possible for us to do some amount of traveling.<br>q<br>How do you plan to achieve your career goals?<br>a<br>As I said, my goal is to continue to develop and improve as a software engineer. To do this, unless I\'m in a real<br>crunch period, I try to put aside a few minutes every day to look at new technologies that I am interested in, like<br>struts, for example.<br>q<br>What are the most important rewards you expect in your career?<br>a<br>The satisfaction of doing excellent work and being respected by my peers, and just being free to create software and<br>get it to people whom it will help. And oc I hope for a comfortable living.<br>q<br>What do you expect to be earning in five years?<br>a<br>I think the answer to this question really depends on market conditions. What I expect to earn today has little to do<br>with what I expected to earn a couple of years ago, and I think that predicting how the industry will of all is a very<br>ambitious endeavor. There are several conflicting trends which affect the compensation for software engineers. On the<br>one hand there is the trend toward sending this work offshore. On the other hand, the work is, in my opinion, getting<br>harder and requiring more sophistication. Of course some people would dispute this and point to such packages as<br>Visual Basic as an example of very simple software environments which are capable of producing slick looking<br>applications. I really couldn\'t guess what the sum of all these factors will be.<br>q<br>Why did you choose this career?<br>a<br>Because I think software engineering is more fun than any other job that I can think of. It\'s a constant battle to<br>figure out various puzzles, and it also has the satisfaction of creating something new and in a way living.<br>q<br>What’s more important to you -- the work itself or how much you’re paid for doing it.<br>a<br>they are both important. Even if I completely loved my work, if I were paid a salary well below my market value, I<br>would feel that I was not doing the right thing for my family. And that the other end of the spectrum, even if I were<br>earning a fantastic salary, I wouldn\'t be happy if I hated the work.

And from the other side of it, I think the value of a creative engineer is much reduced if he isn\'t efficient, just because one has to be efficient to avoid being in a crisis-driven mode where there\'s no time and freedom to experiment and evolve one\'s methods.<br>q<br>What’s the most recent book you’ve read?<br>a<br>TODO<br>q<br>Describe the relationship that should exist between the supervisor and those reporting to him or her?<br>a<br>I like the idea of a divison of responsibility where the manager tracks the evolving needs of the organization and thereby is able to set priorities and schedules, while the engineer follows those priorities and does what needs to be done in order to make the schedules with a clean product.<br>q<br>Describe the most rewarding experience of your career thus far.<br>What two or three accomplishments have given you the most satisfaction?
