Instead, the Thread class was modified to support ThreadLocal by adding an instance variable to Thread that holds a HashMap mapping thread-local variables to their values for the current thread. Because the process of retrieving or setting a thread-local variable does not involve reading or writing data that might be read or written by another thread, you can implement ThreadLocal.get() and set() without any synchronization. Also, because the references to the per-thread values are stored in the owning Thread object, when the Thread gets garbage collected, so can its per-thread values.<br>&nbsp;Unfortunately, even with these improvements, the performance of ThreadLocal under Java 1.3 is still surprisingly slow. My rough benchmarks running the Sun 1.3 JDK on a two-processor Linux system show that a ThreadLocal.get() operation takes about twice as long as an uncontended synchronization.<br>&nbsp;For 1.4, rewritten again; much faster.

'A' => 'There are several known use cases for an ESB within the current Plumtree product suite. In three of them, the PMB is already serving a role:<ul><li>Logging: Log messages from multiple portal components are transmitted to via the PMB to collectors (e.g., PTSpy) on remote machines. Different collectors can receive the same messages.</li><li>Event monitoring: In response to actions within the portal, messages are sent over the PMB to a dedicated collector within the Analytics Server. Data extracted from the messages is stored in a database for report generation.</li><li>Distributed caching: The OpenSharedCache implementation is being used within the Martok portal to maintain a distributed cache of session objects within the portal servers. Cache updates are asynchronously communicated to other servers, and a state-transfer facility allows re-population of caches upon startup. The current implementation is functional but not particularly robust. In this case, coherency errors are non-fatal (the worst that happens is that a user loses some local state and must log in again) and could be minimized via frequent cache expiry and semi-pessimistic updating. A related use case comes from Collaboration Server, where JGroups messaging is used to invalidate cache entries.</li><li>Notification service: There are currently a number of mechanisms for sending email from the portal. A single notification service would simplify product designs. An RPC mechanism for invoking such a service would suffice, but an asynchronous message queue would be a perfect fit.</li><li>Security/object cache management: The G7 security management service (and potentially an associated object store) will require local caches of centrally stored information. These caches and related data structures will require greater reliability guarantees than the portal session caches. An ESB supporting reliable messaging would provide the necessary infrastructure. Cooperating components would exchange update messages on a dedicated communication channel.</li><li>Pushing security updates: Within Collab, Content and Workflow, security information needs to be updated whenever it changes in the portal. These portal components must currently poll the portal (or portal database) to detect updates. An ESB would simplify the integration of these components by providing a channel for publishing security updates. This is a case where reliable, persistent (and possibly transactional) messaging is a key requirement.</li><li>Service invocation: Communication between components in an SOA (the current designs for the Hydrogen project represent a good example: <a href=\'http://portal.plumtree.com/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_32_0_9405_0_-1_47/http\'>http://portal.plumtree.com/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_32_0_9405_0_-1_47/http</a>;/prodgadget12.plumtree.com/collab/do/document/overview?projID=12583&folderID=148910) could benefit from a low-overhead, high-throughput ESB implementation that includes support for synchronous or half-sync/half-async request-reply strategies. ESBs are largely payload-agnostic, so whether the messages contain SOAP, Hessian, or serialized POJO data isn¢t really important (so long as sender and receiver agree). Formalizing the configuration of the channels connecting the components can help during deployment and management. An ESB will typically provide support for wiretaps and conditional routers that can be spliced into the communication channels to help with debugging and performance analysis.</li></ul> ',

It¢s still relatively new, but it does show how to merge concepts from the Web Services and Message Oriented Middleware (i.e., ESB) spheres.<br>The messaging infrastructure is based on JAX-RPC (SOAP) but provides support for ESB-style asynchronous message channels. Messages pass through what¢s termed a Normalized Message Router which can handle the details of sending the message over the wire, or transferring it directly to an in-process receiver. Communicating components are unaware of nature of the connection between them: the JBI container configuration specifies how the components are wired together. Messages in the system are tagged with properties in a standard (-Y´normalized¡) fashion that allows routing decisions to be made independently of any knowledge of the actual message body another key feature of ESB implementations.<br>The JBI spec also addresses issues surrounding deployment and administration of components within the JBI containers, but it¢s currently pretty sketchy.<br>Finally, the JBI spec includes the notion of a Binding Component. These can act as Service Adapters to talk to existing application APIs outside the JBI environment, or as Message Bridges to translate between JBI Normalized Messages and other wire protocols using WSDL information to guide the transformation. Binding components can act as outgoing or incoming message endpoints.<br>Suffice it to say, this is an interesting standard to examine given the goals of the G7 architecture.
