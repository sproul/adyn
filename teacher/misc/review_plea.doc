I am writing software to help me study foreign languages (and, with luck, will eventually form the basis for a product).  This software essentially reproduces the functionality of flash cards, but the translation exercises are in terms of simple sentences instead of individual words.  I'd hoped that the numerous online free translation services available through the web would be able to provide me with a supply of translations of the simple sentences which I could use for my program.  However, the quality of the translations these services have provided is very low, and it has become clear that the translations must be reviewed and corrected by competent individuals before the software will be usable.

So I was wondering if @@ would be willing to review some @@Spanish@@Italian translations.
