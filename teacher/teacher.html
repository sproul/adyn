<h2>Teacher Overview</h2>
The capacity of short-term memory to absorb new information is limited, and so a key to maximizing learning is to limit the set of material being considered at a given moment.  When working with flashcards -- whether conventional or in software -- one accomplishes this by leaving most of the cards in the box (or on the website), grabbing a manageable pile to master onto your table (or onto your PC).  One might further select an even smaller group of cards with the most difficult exercises in one's hands.  Teacher organizes the exercises, or flashcards, along these same lines.  The student moves flashcards between his "hands" and the "table" by using the <!--link setButtons flashcard set buttons--><a href=#setButtons>flashcard set buttons</a>.
<p>
Though this product is essentially a software version of flash cards, there are some important differences and improvements which make it a much more effective teaching tool:
<ul>
<li>
Teacher's translation exercises are in terms of sentences, not words.  This is because the human mind naturally learns language in terms of phrases and sentences with context, not words memorized in isolation.
</li>
<li>
The tool automatically tracks students' progress in various topics, and so is able to adapt the selection of flashcards to fit students' individual needs.
</li>
<li>
The tool remembers from day to day and from week to week what flashcards individual students have struggled with, and so can modify the courses of study to reflect this memory.
</li>
<li>
The tool allows users to explicitly specify topics for emphasis.
</li>
<li>
The tool provides grammatical notes explaining special cases and grammar rules relevant to each flashcard.
</li>
<li>
The tool's flashcards are cross linked with an online grammar explaining the grammatical principles covered.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
As foreign language students pursue their studies, they will find that there are specific areas where they struggle which vary by the individual.  Ideally a successful learning system will focus a student on those areas where he is weakest.  To achieve this, this system categorizes all flashcards according to what areas of knowledge they cover, and then tracks the performance of the student across these categories.  In this way the student's weaknesses can be identified and then attacked by emphasizing flashcards which cover those weak points.  The student's strength in any area is continually measured and updated to allow the system to intelligently recognize his progress and adjust its reckoning of the student's relative weaknesses.  So for example, if a French student has problems with translations requiring use of the subjunctive case, the system should recognize this weakness and select an increasing proportion of flashcards which involve subjunctive usages.

<h2>Quick Guide to the Fundamentals</h2>
<!--chunk teacherFundamentals-->
<p>
Initially the user fills out a form, called the <!--link exerciseSelectionPanel flashcard selection panel--><a href=#exerciseSelectionPanel>flashcard selection panel</a>.
Using this form, the user is able to describe what kind of flashcards are desired.  After submitting the form, some number of flashcards -- by default 15 -- are gathered from the Web site box, and retrieved to the user's "table" -- or PC.  These flashcards make up the <!--link tableSet Table Set--><a href=#tableSet>Table Set</a> of flashcards, which can be thought of as the fistful of cards the user has initially grabbed out of the box to work with.
<p>
There is another named set of exercises the user works with, called the <!--link handSet Hand Set--><a href=#handSet>Hand Set</a>.  This set of exercises could be considered analogous to the small group of flashcards which the student did not already know and is actively trying to master, and thus is holding in his hands.  Initially the <!--link handSet Hand Set--><a href=#handSet>Hand Set</a> contains just the first exercise taken off the <!--link tableSet Table Set--><a href=#tableSet>Table Set</a>, the prompt for which is immediately displayed.  Typically this prompt will be a sentence in English which the user should then mentally translate.  When the user feels ready, clicking the <b> Show Answer</b> button results in the answer to the translation exercise being displayed.
<p>
At this point, the user has a decision to make.  If the exercise was easy, and nothing is to be gained by seeing this exercise again, then the user should click on the <b>Discard flashcard</b> button; this will result in the exercise being removed from the <!--link handSet Hand Set--><a href=#handSet>Hand Set</a> and discarded, never to be seen again, and then the software either
<ul>
<li>cycles to a previously seen exercise in the Hand Set or</li>
<li>retrieves a new exercise from the <!--link tableSet Table Set--><a href=#tableSet>Table Set</a> into the <!--link handSet Hand Set--><a href=#handSet>Hand Set</a> to be immediately shown.</li>
</ul>
In the latter case, the Hand Set will grow by 1 flashcard; otherwise the Handset will stay the same size.
<p>
If, on the other hand, the user found the vocabulary and grammar covered by the exercise to be challenging, then clicking on the <b>Keep flashcard</b> button would be appropriate; this leaves the current exercise being held in the <!--link handSet Hand Set--><a href=#handSet>Hand Set</a> for continuing review; meanwhile the software either
<li>moves an additional exercise from the <!--link tableSet Table Set--><a href=#tableSet>Table Set</a> into the <!--link handSet Hand Set--><a href=#handSet>Hand Set</a> for immediate display</li>
<li>cycles to a previously seen exercise in the Hand Set.</li>
In the former case, the Hand Set will shrink by 1 flashcard; otherwise the Handset will stay the same size.
<p>
The reader will have noted from the scenarios above that the software has the latitude to cause the Hand Set
<ul>
<li>to grow, </li>
<li>to remain the same size, </li>
<li>or to shrink.</li>
</ul>
It decides which of these options is the most attractive by looking at the user's recent performance: 
<ul>
<li>If it looks like the user is having a very easy time, the software will be biased toward making the Handset bigger so as to be more challenging.  </li>
<li>If it appears that the user is having a very hard time, the software will do what it can to reduce the size of the Hand Set, and so make it easier.  </li>
<li>If the situation is somewhere between these extremes, the software will avoid changing the size of the Hand Set.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The product remembers which exercises the user does not immediately discard.  Not immediately discarding an exercise is taken to be an indication that the exercise is difficult for this user, and should be added to the <!--link reviewExercises Review Set--><a href=#reviewExercises>Review Set</a> of exercises.  The Review Set of exercises is kept track of on the Web site, and in subsequent sessions (which could take place weeks later) when the user requests flashcards to work on, the system will automatically sprinkle exercises taken from the Review Set among those flashcards retrieved.  Thus there is a continual review of difficult items across sessions.

<h2>The Topic</h2>
</a>
Often a student will be aware of weaknesses which are not broad enough for the system to detect.  For example, a student might struggle with the conjugation of a particular irregular verb; there might not be a sufficient number of flashcards using that verb for the system to identify this weakness.  To address this situation, the system gives the user the power to actively select limited areas of knowledge for focused flashcards by means of the <!--link topicButtons topic control buttons--><a href=#topicButtons>topic control buttons</a>.  In the case of the example of the student who struggles with a particular verb, the system will often make the verb a link which when clicked on will open a new browser window dedicated to flashcards exclusively focused on the use of this verb; so all flashcards the student sees in this window will involve the troublesome verb.  Once the student has had enough, he can kill that window and return to the previous focus (in the original window).
<p>
The student can repeatedly create new windows dedicated to different topics as he becomes aware of areas that he wants to focus on.  The student can change the current topic by either 
<ul>
<li>clicking on a flashcard link in the translation or</li>
<li>explicitly requesting a topic via the topic control buttons.
</ul>

<!--anchor topicButtons--><a name=topicButtons></a>
<h2>Changing the Subject: Using the Topic Control Buttons</h2>
The user can at any time request exercises which focus on a particular area of grammar or vocabulary by means of buttons below the translation flashcard.
<ul>
<li>
<b>Change topic</b>: clicking this button will allow you to change the topic for the current window.
</li>
<li>
<b>Add new topic</b>: clicking this button will create a new browser window in which you can focus on a new topic.
</li>
<li>
<b>Logoff</b>: clicking this button end the user's teacher session.  Once the session has been ended, if a student wishes to use the product, it will be necessary to login.
</li>
<li>
<b>Help</b>: clicking this button will take the user to this documentation.
</li>
</ul>


<!--anchor setButtons--><a name=setButtons></a>
<h2> Controlling the Exercise Sets</h2>
Each time the user uses the product, a set of flashcards is gathered onto his PC.  The user proceeds through the flashcards, discarding the ones which he gets correctly, and keeping the ones which he doesn't get correctly.  The software pays attention to what the user is doing; flashcards which are immediately discarded are assumed to be uninteresting for the user, and so will not be fetched for future sessions.  The flashcards which are kept are assumed to be interesting for the user, and so will very likely be a part of future sessions.
<p>

How does the software rate how interesting each flashcard is?
<p>

The software keeps track of how interesting the flashcards are to each user.  To accomplish this task, the software associates a numerical weight with each flashcard.  The "heavier" a flashcard is, the more interesting it is for the user.  Each time the user sees a flashcard and clicks on the <b>Keep flashcard</b> button, the weight for that particular flashcard goes up.  Conversely, each time the user sees a flashcard and clicks on the Discard flashcard button, that flashcard's weight goes down.  The flashcards start with a weight of zero; flashcards with weights which are less than zero are never retrieved for the user, while flashcards with positive weights are very likely to be retrieved for the user as Review exercises.

<p>
At any given moment, the user is working with three sets of flashcards: the <i><!--link tableSet Table Set--><a href=#tableSet>Table Set</a></i>, which is the set of flashcards which he draws from, and the <i><!--link handSet Hand Set--><a href=#handSet>Hand Set</a></i>, which is the set of flashcards the user has seen but has not discarded.  Presumably the Hand Set will be a small set of flashcards covering material the user wants to study.  Above the translation exercises is a set of buttons which allows the user to move flashcards into and out of the <!--link handSet Hand Set--><a href=#handSet>Hand Set</a>.  When the user initially brings up the tool, the <!--link handSet Hand Set--><a href=#handSet>Hand Set</a> contains just the flashcard being displayed, while the <!--link tableSet Table Set--><a href=#tableSet>Table Set</a> contains some number of flashcards which satisfy the user's selection criteria.
<ul>
<li>
<b>Show Answer</b>: clicking this button will result in translation problem's answer being displayed.
</li>
<li>
<b>Keep flashcard</b>: clicking this button will result in a new exercise being retrieved from the <!--link tableSet Table Set--><a href=#tableSet>Table Set</a> (the set of exercises you retrieved to your PC), being added to the <!--link handSet Hand Set--><a href=#handSet>Hand Set</a>, and being displayed to the user.  You should click this button if you do not get the <!--link correct correct--><a href=#correct>correct</a> answer (<i>and</i> you want to see a new exercise; if you would rather not add a new exercise, and just focus for the moment on the exercises you have already seen in this session, then you should click the <b>Cycle flashcards in hand</b> button).
</li>
<li>
<b>Discard flashcard</b>: clicking this button will result in the current exercise being removed from the <!--link handSet Hand Set--><a href=#handSet>Hand Set</a> and discarded.  You should click this button if you get the <!--link correct correct--><a href=#correct>correct</a> answer (<i>and</i> you just want to work on the exercises in your <!--link handSet Hand Set--><a href=#handSet>Hand Set</a>; if you want to immediately add a new exercise to the Hand Set, then you should click the <b>Keep flashcard</b> button).
</li>
<li>
<b>Help</b>: clicking this button will take the user to this documentation.
</li>
</ul>

<!--anchor reviewExercises--><a name=reviewExercises></a>
<h2>Review Exercises</h2>
</a>
As a user uses the tool, the software monitors which exercises are not immediately discarded or replaced; these exercises are added to the set of exercises called <i>Review Set</i>.  At <!--link whenIsWebSiteUpdated various times--><a href=#whenIsWebSiteUpdated>various times</a> the software contacts the Web site to tell it about exercises which should be added to or subtracted from the Review Set of exercises; then when the user requests exercises from the
<!--link exerciseSelectionPanel exercise selection panels--><a href=#exerciseSelectionPanel>exercise selection panels</a>, exercises from the Review Set are added among the exercises which were requested.  Thus the user continually reviews difficult exercises.
<p>
The proportion of review exercises among the exercises retrieved is determined by the <b>Percentage of exercises wanted from Review Set</b> setting.  If the user doesn't want any, then this value should be set to zero; by default, this value is set to 50%.

<h3>How exercises are added to the Review Set</h3>
Any exercise which the user does not immediately discard or replace is automatically added to the Review Set.  So, for example, imagine the following sequence of actions:

<ul>
<li>Exercise #0 is displayed.</li>
<li>User clicks on <b>Keep flashcard</b>, causing Exercise #0 to be remain in the <!--link handSet Hand Set--><a href=#handSet>Hand Set</a>, and Exercise #1 to be displayed.</li>
<li>User clicks on <b>Show Answer</b>.</li>
<li>User clicks on <b>Discard flashcard</b>, causing Exercise #1 to be thrown away, and Exercise #2 to be displayed.</li>
<li>User clicks on <b>Show Answer</b>.</li>
<li>User clicks on <b>Keep flashcard</b>, causing Exercise #2 to be remain in the <!--link handSet Hand Set--><a href=#handSet>Hand Set</a>, and Exercise #3 to be displayed.</li>
<li>User clicks on <b>Show Answer</b>.</li>
<li>User clicks on <b>Discard flashcard</b>, causing Exercise #3 to be thrown away, and Exercise #0 to be displayed again.</li>
<li>User clicks on <b>Show Answer</b>.</li>
<li>User clicks on <b>Discard flashcard</b>, causing Exercise #0 to be thrown away.
<li>User clicks on <b>Logoff</b>, ending this session.
</ul>

In this example, Exercise #0 and Exercise #2 will be added to the <!--link reviewExercises Review Set--><a href=#reviewExercises>Review Set</a>.  Note that although Exercise #0 was eventually discarded, the fact that it was not discarded at the first opportunity was noted by the system as a sign that the user has not yet learned the material covered by this exercise, and so could profit by this exercise being added to the <!--link reviewExercises Review Set--><a href=#reviewExercises>Review Set</a>.
<h3>How exercises are removed from the Review Set</h3>

<p>
In general the user will always be reviewing the review exercises at least part of the time, since they are automatically sprinkled among exercises the user retrieves via the <!--link exerciseSelectionPanel exercise selection panels--><a href=#exerciseSelectionPanel>exercise selection panels</a>.


<!--anchor whenIsWebSiteUpdated--><a name=whenIsWebSiteUpdated></a> 
<h3>When Is the Web Site Updated with the User's Performance Info?</h3>
</a>
<ul>
<li>After every dozen or so exercises, the software automatically saves the information.</li>
<li>When the user clicks on the <b>Logoff</b> button (more info at <a hef=#setButtons>exercise set buttons</a>).</li>
</ul>

<!--anchor stoppingReviewExercises--><a name=stoppingReviewExercises></a>
<h3>How to Temporarily Stop Review Exercises</h3>
At the bottom of the <a href=html/choose.html>long form</a> (which is one of the two <!--link exerciseSelectionPanel forms with which users can request exercises--><a href=#exerciseSelectionPanel>forms with which users can request exercises</a>) you can enter the percentage of review exercises.  By default, when you ask for some exercises, 50% of the exercises returned will be review exercises, e.g., exercises which you have struggled over in the past, but did not explicitly ask for in the current session.  If you set the review exercise percentage to zero, then no review exercises will be added.

<!--anchor resetReviewExercises--><a name=resetReviewExercises></a>
<h3>Emptying the Review Set</h3>
Each time a user goes through a session with the product, exercises are added to that user's set of review exercises.  And so each time exercises are retrieved from the web site, some number of review exercises will be drawn from the review set for further study.  If the user decides that the set of review exercises is not suitable, it is possible to empty out the review set and start over as if the user were using the product for the first time.
<p>
To accomplish this, the user should check the <b>Empty review set</b> checkbox near the bottom of the long form (see the <!--link exerciseSelectionPanel section on the exercise selection panels--><a href=#exerciseSelectionPanel>section on the exercise selection panels</a> for a discussion of the short and long forms).


<!--anchor exerciseSelectionPanel--><a name=exerciseSelectionPanel></a>
<!--anchor flashcardSelectionPanel--><a name=flashcardSelectionPanel></a>
<h2>The Exercise Selection Panels</h2>
</a>
There are two exercise selection panels: the <a href=html/simple_choose.htm>short form</a>, which is relatively short and simple, and the <a href=html/choose.html>long form</a>, which is longer.  They serve essentially the same function, but one of them is simple (and doesn't give the user many choices), and the other one is more complicated (and does give the user a number of choices).  The user can switch forms at any time.  From the simple form, the user can go to the more complicated form by clicking on the <b> Advanced</b> button at the top of the page.  To go from the more complicated form to the simple form, the user need only click on the <b> Simpler</b> button at the top of the page.
<p>
From the exercise selection panels, the user fills out a form to indicate what kinds of exercises are desired.  Once the form has been submitted, a list of suitable exercises is gathered on the Web site and returned to the browser.  Mixed in with these exercises will also be exercises taken from the user's <!--link reviewExercises Review Set--><a href=#reviewExercises>Review Set</a>.

<h3>1. Choose the languages you want to work on</h3>
This section lets you select what languages will be displayed.  Thus, if you were studying only French, you would only check the French check box.  If you're studying both French and German, you would check both the French and German check boxes.

<h3>2. Choose the language you will be prompted in </h3>
This section lets you choose what language you will be prompted in.  This line will normally be your native language, e.g., English for people from the United States.  Whichever language you select here will be the language used to display the translation prompts in the exercises.

<h3>3. Select the tenses you want to work on </h3>
This section lets you select which grammatical tenses or moods you will be working with.  If you are a relatively advanced student, it will be appropriate for you to check the box marked <b>All</b>, indicating that you want to see exercises for all possible tenses.  If you are less advanced, then you will check only those checkboxes corresponding to those tenses you want to see and the exercises you will be doing.

<h3>4. Select the desired type of exercise </h3>
In this section select what category of exercises you want to work with.  The possibilities are:

<ul>
<li><b>Random sentences</b>: These exercises are the most complex, covering various grammatical situations, with no constraints on the grammatical forms used.</li>
<li><b>Exercises from the <!--link reviewExercises Review Set--><a href=#reviewExercises>Review Set</a></b>: If you choose this option, all the exercises you see will be selected from those exercises you have struggled with in the past..</li>
<li><b>Random conjugational exercises</b>: These exercises are simpler sentences, almost always using a single verb each.</li>
<li><b>Conjugational exercises for selected verb(s)</b>: These exercises are the same as the <b>Random conjugational exercises</b>, except that they use only verbs that the user selects from the combo box on the right.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Get to work</h3>
Once you click on the <b>Submit</b> button, the Web site will gather together exercises which match the criteria you have specified.  It will also sprinkle among them exercises taken from your <!--link reviewExercises exercise Review Set--><a href=#reviewExercises>exercise Review Set</a>, even though these exercises may not match the criteria you have just specified.  The thinking here is that although you may want to emphasize certain grammatical areas day by day, the job of reviewing those exercises which you have found difficult in the past should be continually done, even if these exercises do not conform to your primary focus of the moment.

<!--anchor correct--><a name=correct></a>
<h2>What does it mean to be "correct"?</h2>

The answer to this question depends on the user.  The thing to keep in mind is that when you tell the software that you got the "correct" answer to an exercise (by clicking on <b>Discard flashcard</b> button), the software will see to it that you are less likely to see that exercise again.  If, on the other hand, you tell the software that you did not get the "correct" answer (by clicking on <b>Keep flashcard</b> button) to an exercise, the software will see to it that you are more likely to see that exercise again.  So what "correct" means in this context really depends on the goals of the user.  If the user is determined to be absolutely perfect to the letter for all exercises, then that user will say that being off by one letter means not being "correct."  If the user is just trying to get to a stage where he is able to recognize and understand all the words, but really doesn't care so much about spelling, then mere spelling errors should not stop him from claiming "correctness."
<p>
The desire to make the tool useful for users with such different goals was one motivation for not requiring the user to type in an answer which would then be evaluated by the software.  If a user really didn't care about the ability to spell every word perfectly, it would be annoying to see the software essentially drilling him on his spelling.  But then if the software were programmed to not care so much about spelling, this would be irritating to users who really are trying to perfect their spelling.  Leaving it up to the user to use his own judgment on this question resolves the matter to everyone's satisfaction.
<p>
Another factor in favor of giving the user the power to determine correctness is that it makes the study process much faster.  Slow typers in particular would suffer if it were required that they type out their answers for each flashcard.


<h2>Glossary</h2>
<ul>
<li><!--anchor boxSet--><a name=boxSet></a><b>Box Set</b>: the gigantic set of flashcards sitting "in the box," i.e., on the website, from which the user may retrieve exercises by filling out the <!--link exerciseSelectionPanel exercise selection panel--><a href=#exerciseSelectionPanel>exercise selection panel</a>.
</li>
<li><!--anchor handSet--><a name=handSet></a><b>Hand Set</b>: the small set of exercises which the user has seen <i>but not discarded</i>.  Normally these exercises will cover translations which the user was not able to breeze through.  Pressing the <b>Cycle</b> button (more info at <!--link setButtons exercise set buttons--><a href=#setButtons>exercise set buttons</a>) allows the user to cycle through the exercises in the Hand Set.  It is expected that the user will from time to time cycle through the Hand Set of exercises.  When a user feels that a particular exercise in the Hand Set has been learned, then it will be appropriate to discard that exercise.  But this will not be the last time that the user sees this exercise; since it was not immediately discarded, the system notes that it was not easy and adds it to the user's <!--link reviewSet Review Set--><a href=#reviewSet>Review Set</a>, which is recorded on the Web site.
</li>
<li><!--anchor reviewSet--><a name=reviewSet></a><b>Review Set</b>: the set of exercises which the user has at one time or another struggled over.  Normally exercises from the Review Set are randomly selected and inserted into the flow of exercises the user sees in any given session.
</li>
<li><!--anchor tableSet--><a name=tableSet></a><b>Table Set</b>: the set of exercises which is selected from the website at the beginning of the study session.
	Normally this set of exercises can be divided into two categories:
	<ol>
	<li> Those exercises which the user requested from the
	<!--link exerciseSelectionPanel exercise selection panel--><a href=#exerciseSelectionPanel>exercise selection panel</a>.</li>
	<li> Some exercises randomly chosen by the system from the user's 
	<!--link reviewExercises Review Set--><a href=#reviewExercises>Review Set</a>, i.e., the set of exercises which the user has struggled over in previous sessions.</li>
	</ol>
</li>
<li><!--anchor weight--><a name=weight></a><b>Weight</b>: With each exercise is associated a numeric weight.  If the user has never seen this exercise before, the weight is zero.  If the user sees the exercise and immediately discards it, its weight is reduced.  Essentially, immediately discarding an exercise is interpreted by the software as an indication that the exercise covers material which need not be emphasized.  The larger the weight, the sooner an exercise will be again be shown to the user.  Exercises with negative weights are considered less interesting to the user then exercises which the user has never before seen.  
<p>
If an exercise has a negative weight, it is also assumed that similar or related exercises should also take a back seat to review exercises and exercises the user has never done.
</li>
