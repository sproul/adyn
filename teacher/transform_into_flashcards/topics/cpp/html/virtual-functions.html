<h3>[20.1] What is a &quot;<tt>virtual</tt> member function&quot;?</h3>
<p>From an OO perspective, it is the single most important feature of C++:
<a href="big-picture.html#[6.8]">[6.8]</a>, <a href="big-picture.html#[6.9]">[6.9]</a>.
<p>A <tt>virtual</tt> function allows derived classes to replace the implementation
provided by the base class.  The compiler makes sure the replacement is always
called whenever the object in question is actually of the derived class, even
if the object is accessed by a base pointer rather than a derived pointer.
This allows algorithms in the base class to be replaced in the derived
class, even if users don't know about the derived class.
<p>The derived class can either fully replace (&quot;override&quot;) the base class
member function, or the derived class can partially replace (&quot;augment&quot;) the
base class member function.  The latter is accomplished by having the derived
class member function call the base class member function, if desired.

<h3>[20.2] How can C++ achieve dynamic binding yet also
static typing?</h3>
<p>When you have a pointer to an object, the object may actually be of a class
that is derived from the class of the pointer (e.g., a <tt>Vehicle*</tt> that is
actually pointing to a <tt>Car</tt> object).  Thus there are two types: the (static)
type of the pointer (<tt>Vehicle</tt>, in this case), and the (dynamic) type of the
pointed-to object (<tt>Car</tt>, in this case).
<p><em>Static typing</em> means that the legality of a member function invocation
is checked at the earliest possible moment: by the compiler at compile time.
The compiler uses the static type of the pointer to determine whether the
member function invocation is legal.  If the type of the pointer can handle the
member function, certainly the pointed-to object can handle it as well.  E.g.,
if <tt>Vehicle</tt> has a certain member function, certainly <tt>Car</tt> also has that
member function since <tt>Car</tt> is a kind-of <tt>Vehicle</tt>.
<p><em>Dynamic binding</em> means that the address of the code in a member function
invocation is determined at the last possible moment: based on the dynamic type
of the object at run time.  It is called &quot;dynamic binding&quot; because the binding
to the code that actually gets called is accomplished dynamically (at run
time).  Dynamic binding is a result of <tt>virtual</tt> functions.

<h3>[20.3] What's the difference between how <tt>virtual</tt> and non-<tt>virtual</tt>
member functions are called?</h3>
<p>Non-<tt>virtual</tt> member functions are resolved statically.  That is, the member
function is selected statically (at compile-time) based on the type of the
pointer (or reference) to the object.
<p>In contrast, <tt>virtual</tt> member functions are resolved dynamically (at run-time).
That is, the member function is selected dynamically (at run-time) based on the
type of the object, not the type of the pointer/reference to that object.  This
is called &quot;dynamic binding.&quot; Most compilers use some variant of the following
technique: if the object has one or more <tt>virtual</tt> functions, the compiler puts
a hidden pointer in the object called a &quot;virtual-pointer&quot; or &quot;v-pointer.&quot; This
v-pointer points to a global table called the &quot;virtual-table&quot; or &quot;v-table.&quot;
<p>The compiler creates a v-table for each class that has at least one <tt>virtual</tt>
function.  For example, if class <tt>Circle</tt> has <tt>virtual</tt> functions for <tt>draw()</tt>
and <tt>move()</tt> and <tt>resize()</tt>, there would be exactly one v-table associated with
class <tt>Circle</tt>, even if there were a gazillion <tt>Circle</tt> objects, and the
v-pointer of each of those <tt>Circle</tt> objects would point to the <tt>Circle</tt>
v-table.  The v-table itself has pointers to each of the virtual functions in
the class.  For example, the <tt>Circle</tt> v-table would have three pointers: a
pointer to <tt>Circle::draw()</tt>, a pointer to <tt>Circle::move()</tt>, and a
pointer to <tt>Circle::resize()</tt>.
<p>During a dispatch of a <tt>virtual</tt> function, the run-time system follows the
object's v-pointer to the class's v-table, then follows the appropriate slot in
the v-table to the method code.
<p>The space-cost overhead of the above technique is nominal: an extra pointer per
object (but only for objects that will need to do dynamic binding), plus an
extra pointer per method (but only for virtual methods).  The time-cost
overhead is also fairly nominal: compared to a normal function call, a
<tt>virtual</tt> function call requires two extra fetches (one to get the value of the
v-pointer, a second to get the address of the method).  None of this runtime
activity happens with non-<tt>virtual</tt> functions, since the compiler resolves
non-<tt>virtual</tt> functions exclusively at compile-time based on the type of the
pointer.
<p><em>Note: the above discussion is simplified considerably, since it doesn't
account for extra structural things like multiple inheritance, <tt>virtual</tt>
inheritance, RTTI, etc., nor does it account for space/speed issues such as
page faults, calling a function via a pointer-to-function, etc.  If you want to
know about those other things, please ask <a href="news:comp.lang.c++"><tt>comp.lang.c++</tt></a>; PLEASE

<h3>[20.4] When should my destructor be <tt>virtual</tt>?</h3>
<p>When you may <tt>delete</tt> a derived object via a base pointer.
<p><tt>virtual</tt> functions bind to the code associated with the class of the object,
rather than with the class of the pointer/reference.  When you say <tt>delete&nbsp;basePtr</tt>, and the base class has a <tt>virtual</tt> destructor, the destructor
that gets invoked is the one associated with the type of the object
<tt>*basePtr</tt>, rather than the one associated with the type of the pointer.
This is generally A Good Thing.
<p><em>TECHNO-GEEK WARNING; PUT YOUR PROPELLER HAT ON.</em> <br>
Technically speaking, you need a base class's destructor to be <tt>virtual</tt> if and
only if you intend to allow someone to invoke an object's destructor via a base
class pointer (this is normally done implicitly via <tt>delete</tt>), and the object
being destructed is of a derived class that has a non-trivial destructor.  A
class has a non-trivial destructor if it either has an explicit destructor, or
if it has a member object or a base class that has a non-trivial destructor
(note that this is a recursive definition (e.g., a class has a non-trivial
destructor if it has a member object (which has a base class (which has a
member object (which has a base class (which has an explicit destructor)))))).
<br>
<em>END TECHNO-GEEK WARNING; REMOVE YOUR PROPELLER HAT</em>
<p>If you had a hard grokking the previous rule, try this (over)simplified one on
for size: A class should have a <tt>virtual</tt> destructor unless that class has
<em>no</em> <tt>virtual</tt> functions.  Rationale: if you have any <tt>virtual</tt> functions
at all, you're probably going to be doing &quot;stuff&quot; to derived objects via a base
pointer, and some of the &quot;stuff&quot; you may do may include invoking a destructor
(normally done implicitly via <tt>delete</tt>).  Plus once you've put the first
<tt>virtual</tt> function into a class, you've already paid all the per-object space
cost that you'll ever pay (one pointer per object; note that this is
theoretically compiler-specific; in practice everyone does it pretty much the
same way), so making the destructor virtual won't generally cost you anything
extra.

<h3>[20.5] What is a &quot;<tt>virtual</tt> constructor&quot;?</h3>
<p>An idiom that allows you to do something that C++ doesn't directly support.
<p>You can get the effect of a <tt>virtual</tt> constructor by a <tt>virtual</tt> <tt>clone()</tt>
member function (for copy constructing), or a <tt>virtual</tt> <tt>create()</tt> member
function (for the <a href="ctors.html#[10.4]">default constructor<!--rawtext:[10.4]:rawtext--></a>).
<p><code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;class&nbsp;Shape&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;virtual&nbsp;~Shape()&nbsp;{&nbsp;}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;<a href="virtual-functions.html#[20.4]">A&nbsp;virtual&nbsp;destructor<!--rawtext:[20.4]:rawtext--></a></em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;virtual&nbsp;void&nbsp;draw()&nbsp;=&nbsp;0;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;<a href="abcs.html#[22.4]">A&nbsp;pure&nbsp;virtual&nbsp;function<!--rawtext:[22.4]:rawtext--></a></em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;virtual&nbsp;void&nbsp;move()&nbsp;=&nbsp;0;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;...</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;virtual&nbsp;Shape*&nbsp;clone()&nbsp;&nbsp;const&nbsp;=&nbsp;0;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;Uses&nbsp;the&nbsp;copy&nbsp;constructor</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;virtual&nbsp;Shape*&nbsp;create()&nbsp;const&nbsp;=&nbsp;0;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;Uses&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="ctors.html#[10.4]">default&nbsp;constructor<!--rawtext:[10.4]:rawtext--></a></em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;};<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;class&nbsp;Circle&nbsp;:&nbsp;public&nbsp;Shape&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circle*&nbsp;clone()&nbsp;&nbsp;const&nbsp;{&nbsp;return&nbsp;new&nbsp;Circle(*this);&nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circle*&nbsp;create()&nbsp;const&nbsp;{&nbsp;return&nbsp;new&nbsp;Circle();&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;...</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;};
</code>
<p>In the <tt>clone()</tt> member function, the <tt>new&nbsp;Circle(*this)</tt> code calls
<tt>Circle</tt>'s copy constructor to copy the state of <tt>this</tt> into the newly created
<tt>Circle</tt> object.  In the <tt>create()</tt> member function, the <tt>new&nbsp;Circle()</tt>
code calls <tt>Circle</tt>'s <a href="ctors.html#[10.4]">default constructor<!--rawtext:[10.4]:rawtext--></a>.
<p>Users use these as if they were &quot;<tt>virtual</tt> constructors&quot;:
<p><code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void&nbsp;userCode(Shape&amp;&nbsp;s)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shape*&nbsp;s2&nbsp;=&nbsp;s.clone();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shape*&nbsp;s3&nbsp;=&nbsp;s.create();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;...</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delete&nbsp;s2;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;You&nbsp;probably&nbsp;need&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href="virtual-functions.html#[20.4]">virtual&nbsp;destructor<!--rawtext:[20.4]:rawtext--></a>&nbsp;here</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delete&nbsp;s3;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
</code>
<p>This function will work correctly regardless of whether the <tt>Shape</tt> is a
<tt>Circle</tt>, <tt>Square</tt>, or some other kind-of <tt>Shape</tt> that doesn't even exist yet.
