Hello,

I'm looking for a position in the financial industry which would let me use my solid Java and C++ skills and experience with large databases.  I have written software to evaluate efficient prices for equity options, and also to evaluate equity trading strategies.  I also have extensive experience writing Web applications under NT and UNIX.

I would welcome an opportunity to discuss your work and my background.


Nelson
