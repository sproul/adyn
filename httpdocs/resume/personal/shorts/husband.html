There he is: my husband.  A man as spiteful as he is unattractive.  Ceaselessly scheming to undermine me -- that is, when he isn't collapsed in a hairy pile of potato-chip-crumb-encrusted blubber on the couch, thunderously snoring in front of a blaring television, the remote control barely visible, its tip poking out from two massive folds of fat.  And yet, is he really sleeping?  Too often he lies dormant for hours, spittle collecting at the corner of his mouth, laborious but regular breaths signaling sleep, and then suddenly he erupts with an elephantine roar: some significant event has finally punctuated the flow of moronic sports events which have been my most constant companions through many dark years of joyless marriage.
<p>
But there's no time to rehash the past: a touchdown has been scored -- perhaps the Chippers will beat the Weasels after all!  My husband is a mass of flinging jowls and gesticulations.  Suddenly a fat-encrusted celebratory muscle spasm causes a sweaty remote control to clatter across the floor.  This is my chance: I bound across the room and seize it.  And now the raucous crowd sound is gone, replaced by the cautious intoning of an elderly man in a conservative suit testifying in live CSPAN coverage of the Ways and Means committee.  An eerie calm has descended over the apartment, only disrupted by the squeals and groans of the couch protesting my husband's attempts to stand up.
