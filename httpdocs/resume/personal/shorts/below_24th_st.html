<h3>Below 24th Street</h3>
Last night I was walking down 24th Street, all senses at a peak of alertness, in search of some possibility of adventure.  Everything seemed pretty normal, except for this weird background popping sound.  It was hard to trace it down because of the noise of the traffic, but eventually I realized it was coming from the sewer.  That didn't smell too good, and I almost gave up the whole enterprise, but about two seconds later, this extremely weathered, stooped over old lady turned the corner toward me, carrying a crowbar.  I ran over to her and grabbed one end of it.  Damn!  She was much stronger than she looked, and we ended up wrestling for it on the ground.  It was a test of strength.  She called me a "little bastard" through gritted teeth.  Fortunately one end of the crowbar was a little bit free, so I was able to kind of hit her with that to put a stop to those insults.  All these veins in her forehead looked ready to pop, but finally she let go and I ran away with my prize.  I turned the corner at Noe Street and hid under a parked car.  Seconds later I could see that old biddy sprinting by, looking for me.  She was motoring!  Old people are in pretty good shape sometimes.  I gave her a minute or so to get far away, and then pulled myself back out into the open.
<p>
I walked back to 24th Street, listening for that popping sound.  I got to the manhole and worked it open with the crowbar.  The cover was very heavy, but I was able to wiggle it out of the way.  The popping was much louder now -- it was definitely coming from the sewer -- but I couldn't see anything.  I leaned all the way in there to get a better look.  What a reek!!  My eyes adjusted to the darkness, but all I could see was the scum-encrusted, gurgling black liquid below.  It was nasty!
<p>
The popping sound was louder than ever, and I was really curious, but I didn't know what to do next.  The smell was tremendous.  Then I felt the street vibrating a little; I pulled my head out of the sewer to look back: here comes the #48 bus.  The guy didn't see me, so I had to get out of the street, one way or another.  That's when I decided, "Screw it -- I'm going for it!"  And I dove into the goop.
<p>
It was completely black and nasty, but at least I couldn't smell it for the moment.  I started swimming, but hit my hand really hard on a wall.  I felt over and realized I was in a sewage pipe with no air!  I was close to panicking but saw some dim light ahead, so I desperately started kicking in that direction.  I had no oxygen left, and I'm -- as you know -- a crap swimmer; it was such slow going!  Finally, I was under the light, kicking upward.  Air at last!!  I sucked it in.
<p>
I looked around as I treaded goop, and it appeared that I was in some sort of disgusting tile pool.  I thrashed over to the side and pulled myself out.  The popping sound was really loud.  It looked like there was a passageway leading to and away from the large room I was in.  A man appeared in the passageway, coming toward me.  I was totally scared -- I didn't know what I had blundered into -- but there was nowhere to hide.  He was closer and closer, but didn't seem to be in any haste.
<p>
"Dude!" he greeted me.  "You swam in that shit?  I didn't know anyone used that thing," he said, motioning at the pool.
<p>
"Uh, I'm new here," I stammered.  "Is there anywhere I can get cleaned up?"
<p>
"No worries!"  He uncoiled a hose from the wall and started spraying the shit off of me.  "New, huh?  Have you gotten the tour?"
<p>
"No," I shook my head, adding that I was very curious to see what's going on.
<p>
Once I was clean, he led me out the passageway, going on and on about how disorganized the welcoming committee was, how little pride they took in their jobs, etc.
<p>
"So what is this place?"  I asked.
<p>
"It's the Underground Noe Center for Sports and Therapy.  We specialize in dwarf toss training and obesity affirmation."  He opened a massive, squeaky door, and we found ourselves in a gymnasium.  At one end was a line of very big, muscular guys, real shot-put types.  There was a conveyor belt packed with smiling dwarves leading to them.  As each one arrived, one of the big guys would pick him up by a strap on his back, and with a vast whirling motion, hurl the little guy across the gymnasium to a lavishly padded area.  With each landing, a pair of judges would run out with tape measures to mark the spot and call out the coordinates.
<p>
"Why are those little people so happy?"  I wondered.
<p>
"They love their work, and also they're in line for big raises, thanks to the Living Wage Initiative.  That's going to be tough on the old piggy bank!  We thought we could get away from all the interference of those bleeding-heart Democrats by going underground, but you just can't escape it in this city."
<p>
So we admired the efforts of the dwarf tossers for a few minutes.  Apparently, they have high hopes at the Center that the sport will be sanctioned for the Olympics eventually, although they've given up on participating in Sydney.  What a stupendous day that will be, when the air high above the Stadio Olympico is filled with dwarves rocketing for glory!  And with the intense regimen of our San Francisco competitors, I think Dwarf Toss Team USA has a golden future!
<p>
After a spasm of patriotism during which we sang the words we knew from the Star Spangled Banner, we left.  That's when it occurred to me that I had still not gotten to the bottom of the popping sound, which had continued unabated throughout my visit.  I asked my guide about it, which seemed to really delight him.  "That's like, totally apropos!"  And with a flourish, he swung open another big door, revealing a scene that I wasn't really prepared for: it was a giant padded room, with a dozen monstrously fat guys rolling around on the floor at very high speeds, grinning wildly, popping balloons with their bodies.
<p>
"We like to think of this as our Big Idea: it's therapy as a metaphor, where we teach obese individuals to feel comfortable and powerful with their bodies as they perform maneuvers impossible for more fragilely proportioned individuals, and in so doing crush their enemy balloons."
<p>
I was curious: "If they are crushing their enemies, why do they look so friendly?"
<p>
"Theirs is a smile that tells the world: 'I am an AmeriCAN, not an AmeriCAN'T.'"
<p>
Impressive.  So we hung out watching those guys exercise their craft for a while.  They really were very skilled, and I couldn't help but wonder if therapeutic balloon popping might not also eventually become an Olympic sport.  Anyway, eventually my guide needed to get back to work, so he showed me to a stairway leading to a hatch which was the normal way to enter the Center.  I shook his hand, clumsily trying to articulate my gratitude to him for having showed me so much.  I've lived in this neighborhood for 11 years now and always thought I was above just an ordinary, somewhat stinky sewer system, when it was really that but also an underground nerve center for vital activities.
<p>
I crawled through the hatch to return to the ordinary world.  It led into a clump of bushes, which I pushed out of to find myself back on 24th Street.  The adventure was over.
<p>
Or was it? I could hear some commotion down the street where there was a crowd of people carrying a bunch of lights.  I was curious to see what was going on, so I jogged over and then realized it was that same old lady I stole the crowbar from, with a mob of people carrying torches.  "There's the little bastard!" she yelled out, pointing at me.  They all started chasing me.  I had a huge adrenaline rush which let me run really fast and, at the same time, race through how I could persuade them that it was all someone else's fault and that they should really just get onto a bus and go confront someone else.  But then I realized they were not gaining on me.  What a bunch of dorks!  In 21st century San Francisco, there are plenty of street lights -- there's just no reason to be carrying heavy kerosene torches.  But I'm glad they were, because it slowed them right down, especially when I hit the hill at full speed.
<p>
So I went and picked up my salad and slipped home.  My apartment never seemed like such a sanctuary!  And of my adventure there was no trace, except for bits of sewage under my fingernails.
