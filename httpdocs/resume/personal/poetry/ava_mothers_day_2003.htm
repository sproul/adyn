<h3>From Ava to the Mothers</h3>
<br>
<br>
I'd like to start this off with an apology to my mother for the gigantic size of my head.<br>
It is to compensate you that I spend so much time in bed.<br>
<br>
Let's be honest: Mom, you never realized motherhood could be so easy.<br>
Maybe my post-breastfeeding diapers will make you a little more queasy.<br>
<br>
Anyhoo, I promise no terrible twos, or teen alienation,<br>
I promise good behavior, even <i>after</i> lactation!<br>
<br>
I promise not to date any boys named Loco or Spider<br>
or else my parents might decide, hey!  Let's hide her!<br>
<br>
And sorry, granny -- I won't date Will or Henry either, even if they are the cutest boys I'll be meeting...<br>
cuz we've seen the terrible price England has already paid for rampant inbreeding.<br>
<br>
Once I can write I'll send my grandmothers many letters,<br>
Til then please keep knitting me those toasty sweaters.<br>
<br>
And at school I promise to work my hardest, and gain much knowledge...<br>
cuz Poppa's not going to pay for college.<br>
<br>
And one last note -- if he's done nothing, at Kevin no one need yell<br>
because I have taken it upon myself to mention his wife, Danielle.<br>
<br>
Happy Mother's Day.<br>
