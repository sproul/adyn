Hi Nelson,



Thank you for your response.  What is the status with your new job prospect?  Should you and I still discuss a job possibility here at PayPal?  Please let me know.  Thank you.

hi Andrew,



I am looking for work, although I think I will be coming to terms for a new job within the next few days.



Attached is my resume in a Word doc; below is a text version.



I am at 203.966.2059 today, will be traveling tomorrow, and should be home again at 415.647.8378 on Wednesday (unless I fail in my bid to stand by for a seat on a plane tomorrow).



All the best,



Nelson Sproul
