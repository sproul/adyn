upgrade so smooth


Hi Nelson,

I really appreciate your extra efforts to make the data conversion last
night.
Therefore, we could finish the upgrade earlier and make the upgrade
process run more smoothly.

You really did a great job.
Have a great nice long weekend.

Thanks a lot.

Grace
