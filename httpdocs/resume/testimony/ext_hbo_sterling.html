Nelson,

Thanks for all the hard-work and wonderful ideas these past two 
weeks!!!  It's made a big difference.

Have a great trip and I'll write/talk later.   (I still have to review all 
your updates :-).)  I hope the first leg of driving went well.


Sterls

BTW, I slept all today... stayed at work until 7 am checking things and 
then FedEx'd the notebook to HBO at 9:30 am.... sleep continued until 8pm.
