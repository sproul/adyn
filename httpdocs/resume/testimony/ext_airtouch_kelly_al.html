Nelson,

Thanks for all your hard work and dedication, particularly at AirTouch!
It does go noticed.

Kelly,

Thanks very much for the feedback.  Nelson is one of our STARS.

I was here working one night a few weeks ago (a little past mid-night)
and noticed Nelson working in his cubicle.  I asked him what he was up
to, and he told me he was working on routines to be used for Airtouch -
wanted to make sure everything was going to run smoothly in March.
Nelson is a very dedicated individual.

Please keep me abreast of your progress with the implementation.  I get
periodic updates from Linda and Patrice, but it's always nice to hear
from the "customer".

Thanks again for the feedback on Nelson!

Regards,
  Al

Hi Al,

I have a few seconds and wanted to give you a quick update on where we
are at in implementation.

We will have to push testing out through the end of next week, and possibly into
the 1st couple of days the following week (so 3/20-21) given the amount of
retesting rear needing to do on functionality and imports......BUT, I can live
with it.  We want a clean product to hand over to our Pilot test group, and
since they consist of some high-level people...... the fewer boo boos the better
:-).  If all goes well, we will be able to roll out Extensity end April, 1st
week May to the balance of the business

I would like to give some very specific kudos for Nelson Sproul!  We will be
forever grateful that he was dedicated specifically to our account.  He is so
good at what he does that he has impressed my ERP team...... and they just
happen to be the best I've had the pleasure to work with in my career.  Between
Nelson on your side, and Brad on our side, I expect to be able to rollout a very
customer satisfying product.

I'll give you another update as we get most of the way through pilot.
