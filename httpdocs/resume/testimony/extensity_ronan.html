Well Nelson, it looks like yet again you have outdone 
yourself. We just got through restoring the berktek 
database on to Griffin using your oracle shell script 
for restoring dumps and yet again you have turned what 
was a 1 to 2 hours manual process into a quick an easy 
script.
<p>
Thanks a ton for helping to streamline our process. 
Hope all going well with you.
<p>
Ronan.
