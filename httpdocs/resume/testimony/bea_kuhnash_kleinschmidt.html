<h3>BEA Performance Appraisal</h3>
<!--
Nelson is a highly effective contributor. He has taken initiative in many areas and reached out to improve tools and process. To help increase his visibility and establish credibility and recognition, he will be asked to give presentations of technical issues to teams inside and outside of SETI. To help him learn more about the people and projects at the company I will involve him in more projects that are related to areas that he currently works in. This will also help increase his visibility and to open communication channels with more people. Nelson will be tasked with greater involvement in automated test planning and build process improvement.

Nelson was rated a highly effective contributor this cycle. He defined the requirements for and implemented the Resource Allocation Service. This service is a keystone of the SkyNet initiative for greater resource tracking and the potential for eliminating much repetitive work. Nelson also was a key contributor to the Selenium effort and helped make this tool a very useful addition to our strategy. Nelson's efforts to support and develop selenium had a substantial impact on the viability and success of that project. His work on the RAS has laid the foundation for significant payback in the near term for QA and Sustaining.
Nelson will be asked to contribute now in a dedicated developer role which will give him the opportunity to deepen various of his programming skills, such as IDE plug-ins, aspect oriented programming, and the automation of machine provisioning (both physical and virtual).

Nelson is passionate about automating our infrastructure and management tools, and working to reduce or eliminate the time spent on repetitive & maintenance tasks. Nelson attempts to prioritize his work based on the overall needs of the business. He is knowledgeable and helpful in many different areas.

Nelson is very passionate about doing a good job. I want Nelson to participate more in discussions and meetings that are more tangential to his day to day tasks. He has good insight to bring to these discussions and can learn much from paying closer attention to those with disparate view points and experiences. To this end I will assign such meetings and collaboration to him from time to time. Near term, I will involve him in the SkyNet test harness planning meetings, Code Coverage tooling meetings, the Release Tool meetings, and Lab management including VMWare and deployment information.
