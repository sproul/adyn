<li>The initial screen is simply a series of links to reports and applications have written for Monroe.  The software is intended purely for internal use, and so the style is strictly functional.

</li>
<li>This is the "trade meeting manager" application, which flags transactions which should be discussed.  (Note that the transactions displayed are not real; rather they are from my test data so as to avoid revealing confidential information.)

</li>
<li>This is the "trading card history" application which lets the traders track the history and profitability of individual securities.  Clicking the "Contacts" button brings up a new window which displays contact information at the company which issued the security.

</li>
<li>Here is the "Rolodex" application for this security.  No contacts have been entered so far; clicking on the "auto populate" button takes us to a page generated by the Perl program web_extract.pl.

<li>Here is the output from the Perl program web_extract.pl.  Following the "Click here" link causes the displayed values to be entered into Monroe's recordkeeping for contacts for this company.
