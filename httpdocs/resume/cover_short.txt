hello,
	
I'm looking for a position which would let me use my solid Java and C++ skills and database experience.

I have designed and implemented software for enterprise financial products deployed at Barclays, JP Morgan, GE Financial, Verizon, HBO, and American Express.

I would welcome an opportunity to discuss your work and my background.


Nelson
