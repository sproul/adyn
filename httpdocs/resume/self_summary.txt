I am a server side enterprise software engineer with a lot of experience writing Web and financial applications in Java, Perl and C++, and with most of the major databases.
Software I've implemented has been deployed for a number of Fortune 500 companies.
I have extensive experience with every phase of the software development cycle, including design, implementation, testing, release engineering, and integration; my primary focus has been on implementation and testing.
Team player?
I am very well versed in object-oriented principles and design patterns, and my working style is very fast and very clean.
