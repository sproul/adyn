 <b>Java OO VM farm controller API</b>: architected and implemented an object oriented API to control VM farms such as VMware's Lab Manager.  This API presents both synchronous and asynchronous interfaces with callbacks that eased integration into diverse contexts, including test scripts and AJAX monitoring web apps.  Structured the code to support multiple additional VM service providers (e.g., based on 
<a href=http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Solaris+zones&btnG=Google+Search>Solaris zones</a> or 
<a href=http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Dynamic+Logical+Partitioning+AIX&btnG=Google+Search>AIX logical partitions</a>)
 without trauma.  Used axis2 to generate initial wrapper code for VMware's SOAP APIs, and JDBC to operate directly on Lab Manager's undocumented internal database to provide functionality not exposed in their APIs (e.g., to allow merging VMs from building block configurations into new test configurations).
</td></tr>
<tr><td> <b>Java/AJAX SNMP resource monitor web application</b>: architected and implemented web application to allocate ownership and monitor the state of machines and other network resources.  The server side is a Java tomcat servlet tested and deployed on Windows, RedHat Linux, and Solaris Unix, using net-snmp to monitor the state of machines.  The client is a JavaScript AJAX app presenting a spreadsheet-like interface of resource attributes chosen by the user.   Used the VMware COM API to communicate with ESX and GSX servers to find and track deployed VMs.  <a href=/resume/testimony/bea_kuhnash_kleinschmidt.html>Feedback</a> was very positive.

Designed and implemented browser session caching, an optimization which tripled Selenium RC's performance.  Designed and implemented various AJAX features including drag-and-drop support in <a href=http://www.openqa.org/selenium-core/>Selenium Core</a>.  The work was implemented in Java within the Selenium server, JavaScript within the browser AJAX client (with support for IE, Firefox, Navigator, Konqueror, and Safari), C#  in the remote test client, with build infrastructure using ant and maven.
</td></tr>
<tr><td> <b>Java/C# .NET Tools Infrastructure</b>: reproduced and fixed bugs in testing infrastructure.  Isolated platform-specific components behind universal interfaces (e.g., designed uniform encapsulation for <a href=http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/jxpath/>Jakarta JXPath</a> and <a href='http://www.google.com/microsoft?hq=microsoft&hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&q=XPathNavigator+%22.NET+Framework+Class+Library%22&btnG=Search'>.NET XPathNavigator</a>).  Improved integration of results reporting with bug database to allow easy navigation and analysis of trees of test suites and cases.  The work was executed in Java and C# under eclipse and Visual Studio..
