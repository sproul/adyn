Important FY '07 Process Information 	   
This form has been designed to reflect BEA's performance management cycle for FY '07 (February 1, 2006 - January 31, 2007). The process begins with an annual goals cascade from the highest levels in the organization, through departments and teams, to first line managers and individual contributors. This cascade provides the link so that each employee is able to set individual key objectives and metrics. Individual objectives should include business objectives which focus on meeting the corporate goals, and development objectives which focus on improving competencies in your current position. Metrics should align with and support the overall strategy of the company.

To begin the process, employees list their measurable development objectives in the "Individual Objectives" section of the form. Employees and managers can utilize this form to modify existing objectives throughout the year. The objective setting and development planning phase is followed by the annual review cycle.

For additional help on development planning, or to focus on career development, employees and managers can utilize the "Development Planning Form" and corresponding tools located at the following link: http://myhr.beasys.com:7501/hr/od_training/performance_mgmt/career_dev/index.jsp.

The form is color-coded by section to help simplify completion: Red: Process and form information, Green: Employee section - employee is responsible for completing these sections, Blue: Manager section - reviewing manager is responsible for completing these sections.

For additional information refer to the "Help" link at the upper right of this page, or select the individual "Instructions" links associated with each section of the form.

Employees should be sure to validate their objectives with their manager. Employees will be asked to provide comments on their performance against their individual objectives in the "Employee Summary Comments" section during the annual review cycle.

- improve test automation infrastructure
o supported search team in their use of xpunit
o resource allocation service: researched needs, built a consensus on a solution, designed and almost finished the implementation of the RAS, a tool to facilitate the allocation and monitoring of test machines and resources of any type.
Competency Definitions

Employee Summary Comments 	   
Looking back over the performance period, employees provide comments on their success against their objectives. Employees write their results against their objectives and include a description of competencies used which contributed to those achievements. Employees state areas they would like to improve upon over the next year to become even more successful in their job.
Employee Summary Comments
My efforts to support and develop selenium had a substantial impact on the viability and success of that project. My work on the RAS has laid the foundation for significant payback in the near term for its users among all of the organizations SETI supports.

Looking ahead to the coming year, I am hoping to continue to support and develop selenium, xpunit, and of course the RAS, in addition to the general firefighting that our group has often performed in the past.

As for my own professional development, I hope to deepen various of my programming skills. In particular, I am very interested in IDE plug-ins, aspect oriented programming (and especially its use within Builder), and the automation of physical and virtual machine provisioning.
Manager Summary Comments 	   
Manager Summary Comments
Nelson is a highly effective contributor. He has taken initiative in many areas and reached out to improve tools and process. To help increase his visibility and establish credibility and recognition, he will be asked to give presentations of technical issues to teams inside and outside of SETI. To help him learn more about the people and projects at the company I will involve him in more projects that are related to areas that he currently works in. This will also help increase his visibility and to open communication channels with more people. Nelson will be tasked with greater involvement in automated test planning and build process improvement.

Nelson was rated a highly effective contributor this cycle. He defined the requirements for and implemented the Resource Allocation Service. This service is a keystone of the SkyNet initiative for greater resource tracking and the potential for eliminating much repetitive work. Nelson also was a key contributor to the Selenium effort and helped make this tool a very useful addition to our strategy. Nelson’s efforts to support and develop selenium had a substantial impact on the viability and success of that project. His work on the RAS has laid the foundation for significant payback in the near term for QA and Sustaining.
Nelson will be asked to contribute now in a dedicated developer role which will give him the opportunity to deepen various of his programming skills, such as IDE plug-ins, aspect oriented programming, and the automation of machine provisioning (both physical and virtual).

Nelson is passionate about automating our infrastructure and management tools, and working to reduce or eliminate the time spent on repetitive & maintenance tasks. Nelson attempts to prioritize his work based on the overall needs of the business. He is knowledgeable and helpful in many different areas.

Nelson is very passionate about doing a good job. I want Nelson to participate more in discussions and meetings that are more tangential to his day to day tasks. He has good insight to bring to these discussions and can learn much from paying closer attention to those with disparate view points and experiences. To this end I will assign such meetings and collaboration to him from time to time. Near term, I will involve him in the SkyNet test harness planning meetings, Code Coverage tooling meetings, the Release Tool meetings, and Lab management including VMWare and deployment information.

To help Nelson settle in to his new role as a dedicated developer, here is a list of actions that he should work with his manager to accomplish:
1. Contribute further to the information system needed by the development, qa and release processes.
2. Contribute to at least 1 information view project - lab pages, dependencies and attributions, release tool.
3. Contribute to Skynet automation by implementation of the system or by working with teams to utilize it's functionality in their own projects.
4. Learn about BuildCommon and contribute new Code Coverage functionality to it.
5. Attend weekly team meetings where he will have an opportunity to teach, learn and exercise presentation skills.
6. Publish a weekly personal status report
8. Create a personal development plan with his manager.
9. Schedule recurring 1:1 meetings with his manager.
10. Identify 2 training courses to attend during the coming year.

It has been a pleasure working with Nelson over the last year. His upbeat attitude, general good humor and infectious energy benefit all of BID.
