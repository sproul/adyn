I have implemented products across IE 3, 4, 5, and 6, as well as
Navigator 4, 6, and 7, resolving incompatibilities as I went.

- Good verbal and written communications skills.
From one of my evaluations at Sybase:

"Nelson communicates clearly, and provides well organized analysis of
issues. Nelson's positive and friendly attitude allow him to easily
communicate with his peers."  My references will confirm that I am a
capable and very willing communicator, in person and in written form.

hello,

I think I am an excellent fit for the Software Engineer position.  I will
make my case by responding to each of the items asked for in the job
listing:

- Experience with workflow, infrastructure, transaction or fulfillment
systems
I have extensive experience implementing for Fortune 100 clients
Extensity's enterprise expense reports applications, which include complex
workflow of documents through various layers of review and integration
with external data feeds (e.g., corporate credit card data, HR databases,
etc.).  This workflow culminates in employees' checks being cut, analogous
to a fulfillment system's culminating in shipment of a physical item.

- Comfortable with databases (20+ terabytes of data in the system)
I have heavy experience over the last ten years programming to databases
from multiple vendors in environments requiring high-performance handling
of frequently huge amounts of data.

- Enjoys solving intense problems and working with other talented
engineers
Resolving difficult technical issues with strong co-workers has been the
highlight of my career.

- Would like a long-term stable career position with great benefits
Just married; long-term + stable sounds excellent to me.

- Has glowing references
They do love me.  I almost find it embarrassing sometimes.  References
available on request.

- Likes a super-casual work environment
yes.

- Has a good sense of humor
My hijinks are legendary, only barely eclipsed by my stupendous
productivity.

- MUST have 4-5 years of professional Java experience
I have six years of pro Java experience.

- MUST have used Java to write test code (test harnesses, test tools or
test suites)
I have written Java test harnesses.

- Must have gone through the bug/QA process with an application you have
written
I have taken several products through the entire development cycle.  Where
I have been allowed to do so, I have attempted to integrate QA and testing
into even the earliest phases of the implementation so that unit tests are
not thrown away and significant changes naturally result in the system
test suite absorbing the corresponding unit tests.  This technique, in
combination with frequent integration, reduces the number of regressions
and prevents instability at the end of the development cycle as the
release date looms.

- Database schema design, stored procedures, triggers, etc.
In my work for Extensity I designed and implemented various tables and
stored procedures to bring about integration of the product with customer
accounting and HR databases.

- Experience developing Java applications in a distributed environment
My work for Whitelight Systems' enterprise OLAP product supported the
analysis and logical aggregation of arbitrary numbers of databases from
different vendors.  My work for Extensity sometimes involved multiple
database servers (although in this case the databases were always from the
same vendor, either Oracle, Sybase or SQL Server).

- Industrial-strength problem-solving skills
I have honed my skills diagnosing and solving problems in complex
environments involving software from disparate vendors across multi-tier
applications.

- Excellent English language communication skills
From one of my evaluations at Sybase: "Nelson communicates clearly, and
provides well organized analysis of issues. Nelson's positive and friendly
attitude allow him to easily communicate with his peers."
My references will confirm that I am a capable and very willing
communicator, in person and in written form.

- 1+ years as a Software QA Engineer (white box).
I spent 3 years doing white box testing for Sybase.


I would welcome an opportunity to discuss your work and my background
further.

P.S.: Below is my resume in plain text.

hey Josh,

I'm curious to know how you became aware of me.

I have most of what the job listing asks for, and if we were having this
conversation several years ago, I would say that I was an excellent match.
 But my understanding is that in these days of plentiful candidates,
 employers are much stricter than they were in asking that all of their
 requirements be satisfied, and there are several which I don't:

|	*	M.S. or equivalent experience

I have a B.S. in computer science from Berkeley.  I have 14 years of
experience in the software industry, but it hasn't been particularly
theoretical.  I'm not sure if this experience is "equivalent" to a M.S.

|	*	Intimate knowledge of Excel macros and experience with VBA

My knowledge of Visual Basic and Excel macros is quite rudimentary,
certainly not intimate.  I don't even mention it on my resume.

|	*	Experience with forward and backward calculation dependency chains

I have never implemented calculation dependency chains, although I am
familiar with their theoretical underpinnings.

If these gaps are not a deal killer, then I think my background is a match
for the rest of the requirements:

|	*	Demonstrated experience designing and implementing a major, server-based subsystem shared by multiple, concurrent users

I have extensive experience engineering server-side middleware solutions
shared by multiple concurrent users.

|	*	J2EE fluency, with an understanding of stateless session beans

My work at Extensity was all in the context of WebLogic's J2EE server.
Although this work did not include stateless session beans, I have written
stateless session beans under Sun's J2EE reference implementation.

|	*	Familiarity with J2EE design patterns

I feel confident of my understanding of the J2EE architecture and the
dominant approaches being taken by designers of performance-critical J2EE
applications.

|	*	Developing and maintaining complex UML diagrams

I have used the UML in several projects.

|	*	Effective written and oral communication skills

From one of my evaluations at Sybase:

"Nelson communicates clearly, and provides well organized analysis of
issues. Nelson's positive and friendly attitude allow him to easily
communicate with his peers."  My references will confirm that I am a
capable and very willing communicator, in person and in written form.

|	*	Minimum 9 years commercial software engineering experience

I have 14 years of selfless toiling in a software engineering capacity.

|	*	Strong, hands-on experience with multi-threading and data synchronization

I have very heavy experience with multithreaded programming and data
synchronization in Java and C++.

|	*	Experience with lexical analysis and expression parsing, defining and maintaining BNF grammar

I have experience designing and implementing cnf, a file processing
language with C-like syntax, using lex and yacc.  I am fluent with
standard BNF also.

|	*	Fluent with XML schema design, generation and parsing

My experience here is on the light side, but I have written Java programs
which parse XML.  My J2EE experience has given me good exposure to XML in
various forms.

|	*	Familiarity with XPath

I am fluent in XPath.

|	*	Understanding of scripting language design and execution

I have designed and implemented several scripting languages.  These
include cnf, the file processing language I mentioned above, and also a
multithreaded scripting language designed to be used as a test harness for
Sybase' transaction management library.

Give me a ring if you would like to discuss your work and my background
further.



Nelson
