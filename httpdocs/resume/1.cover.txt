Hello,

I think my skills and background make me a good match for your
Data Operations Analyst position.

I have eight years of experience working with databases as a software
engineer for companies serving Fortune 500 clients.  This includes work on
the RDBMS development side for Sybase, work on OLAP development for
Whitelight Systems (on a product used by J.P. Morgan), and work as an
integration engineer for Extensity (at Verizon).  My work for Whitelight
involved heavy C++ ODBC application programming using multiple vendors'
databases, including Oracle.

I would welcome an opportunity to discuss your work and my background.


Nelson
