<h3>[21.1] Should I hide member functions that were public in
my base class?</h3>
<p>Never, never, never do this.  Never.  <em>Never!</em>
<p>Attempting to hide (eliminate, revoke, privatize) inherited <tt>public</tt> member
functions is an all-too-common design error.  It usually stems from muddy
thinking.
<p>(Note: this FAQ has to do with <tt>public</tt> inheritance; <a href="private-inheritance.html"><tt>private</tt> and
<tt>protected</tt> inheritance<!--rawtext:[24]:rawtext--></a> are different.)

<h3>[21.2] <tt>Derived*</tt> &#151;&gt; <tt>Base*</tt> works OK; why doesn't
<tt>Derived**</tt> &#151;&gt; <tt>Base**</tt> work?</h3>
<p>C++ allows a <tt>Derived*</tt> to be converted to a <tt>Base*</tt>, since a <tt>Derived</tt> object
is a kind of a <tt>Base</tt> object.  However trying to convert a <tt>Derived**</tt> to a
<tt>Base**</tt> is flagged as an error.  Although this error may not be obvious, it is
nonetheless a good thing.  For example, if you could convert a <tt>Car**</tt> to a
<tt>Vehicle**</tt>, and if you could similarly convert a <tt>NuclearSubmarine**</tt> to a
<tt>Vehicle**</tt>, you could assign those two pointers and end up making a <tt>Car*</tt>
point at a <tt>NuclearSubmarine</tt>:
<p><code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;class&nbsp;Vehicle&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{&nbsp;</tt><em>/*...*/</em><tt>&nbsp;};<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;class&nbsp;Car&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;public&nbsp;Vehicle&nbsp;{&nbsp;</tt><em>/*...*/</em><tt>&nbsp;};<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;class&nbsp;NuclearSubmarine&nbsp;:&nbsp;public&nbsp;Vehicle&nbsp;{&nbsp;</tt><em>/*...*/</em><tt>&nbsp;};<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;main()<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Car&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;car;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Car*&nbsp;&nbsp;carPtr&nbsp;=&nbsp;&amp;car;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Car**&nbsp;carPtrPtr&nbsp;=&nbsp;&amp;carPtr;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vehicle**&nbsp;vehiclePtrPtr&nbsp;=&nbsp;carPtrPtr;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;This&nbsp;is&nbsp;an&nbsp;error&nbsp;in&nbsp;C++</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NuclearSubmarine&nbsp;&nbsp;sub;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NuclearSubmarine*&nbsp;subPtr&nbsp;=&nbsp;&amp;sub;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*vehiclePtrPtr&nbsp;=&nbsp;subPtr;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;This&nbsp;last&nbsp;line&nbsp;would&nbsp;have&nbsp;caused&nbsp;<tt>carPtr</tt>&nbsp;to&nbsp;point&nbsp;to&nbsp;<tt>sub</tt>&nbsp;!</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
</code>
<p>In other words, if it was legal to convert a <tt>Derived**</tt> to a <tt>Base**</tt>, the
<tt>Base**</tt> could be dereferenced (yielding a <tt>Base*</tt>), and the <tt>Base*</tt> could be
made to point to an object of a <em>different</em> derived class, which could
cause serious problems for national security (who knows what would happen if
you invoked the <tt>openGasCap()</tt> member function on what you thought was a <tt>Car</tt>,
but in reality it was a <tt>NuclearSubmarine</tt>!!)..

<h3>[21.3] Is a parking-lot-of-<tt>Car</tt> a kind-of
parking-lot-of-<tt>Vehicle</tt>?</h3>
<p>Nope.
<p>I <em>know</em> it sounds strange, but it's true.  You can think of this as a
direct consequence of the previous FAQ, or you can reason it this way: if the
kind-of relationship were valid, then someone could point a
parking-lot-of-<tt>Vehicle</tt> pointer at a parking-lot-of-<tt>Car</tt>.  But
parking-lot-of-<tt>Vehicle</tt> has a <tt>addNewVehicleToParkingLot(Vehicle&amp;)</tt> member
function which can add any <tt>Vehicle</tt> object to the parking lot.  This would
allow you to park a <tt>NuclearSubmarine</tt> in a parking-lot-of-<tt>Car</tt>.  Certainly it
would be surprising if someone removed what they thought was a <tt>Car</tt> from the
parking-lot-of-<tt>Car</tt>, only to find that it is actually a <tt>NuclearSubmarine</tt>.
<p>Another way to say this truth: a container of <tt>Thing</tt> is <em>not</em> a
kind-of container of <tt>Anything</tt> even if a <tt>Thing</tt> is a kind-of an
<tt>Anything</tt>.  Swallow hard; it's true.
<p>You don't have to like it.  But you do have to accept it.
<p>One last example which we use in our OO/C++ training courses: &quot;A
<tt>Bag</tt>-of-<tt>Apple</tt> is <em>not</em> a kind-of <tt>Bag</tt>-of-<tt>Fruit</tt>.&quot; If a
<tt>Bag</tt>-of-<tt>Apple</tt> <em>could</em> be passed as a <tt>Bag</tt>-of-<tt>Fruit</tt>, someone could
put a <tt>Banana</tt> into the <tt>Bag</tt>, even though it is supposed to only contain
<tt>Apple</tt>s!

<h3>[21.4] Is an array of <tt>Derived</tt> a kind-of array of <tt>Base</tt>?</h3>
<p>Nope.
<p>This is a corollary of the previous FAQ.  Unfortunately this one can get you
into a <em>lot</em> of hot water.  Consider this:
<p><code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;class&nbsp;Base&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;virtual&nbsp;void&nbsp;f();&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;1</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;};<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;class&nbsp;Derived&nbsp;:&nbsp;public&nbsp;Base&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;...</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;private:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int&nbsp;i_;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;2</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;};<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void&nbsp;userCode(Base*&nbsp;arrayOfBase)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arrayOfBase[1].f();&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;3</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;main()<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derived&nbsp;arrayOfDerived[10];&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;4</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;userCode(arrayOfDerived);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;5</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
</code>
<p>The compiler thinks this is perfectly type-safe.  Line 5 converts a <tt>Derived*</tt>
to a <tt>Base*</tt>.  But in reality it is horrendously evil: since <tt>Derived</tt> is
larger than <tt>Base</tt>, the pointer arithmetic done on line 3 is incorrect: the
compiler uses <tt>sizeof(Base)</tt> when computing the address for
<tt>arrayOfBase[1]</tt>, yet the array is an array of <tt>Derived</tt>, which means the
address computed on line 3 (and the subsequent invocation of member function
<tt>f()</tt>) isn't even at the beginning of any object!  It's smack in the middle of
a <tt>Derived</tt> object.  Assuming your compiler uses the usual approach to
<a href="virtual-functions.html"><tt>virtual</tt><!--rawtext:[20]:rawtext--></a> functions, this will reinterpret the
<tt>int&nbsp;i_</tt> of the first <tt>Derived</tt> as if it pointed to a virtual table, it
will follow that &quot;pointer&quot; (which at this point means we're digging stuff out
of a random memory location), and grab one of the first few words of memory at
that location and interpret them as if they were the address of a C++ member
function, then load that (random memory location) into the instruction pointer
and begin grabbing machine instructions from that memory location.  The chances
of this crashing are very high.
<p>The root problem is that C++ can't distinguish between a pointer-to-a-thing and
a pointer-to-an-array-of-things.  Naturally C++ &quot;inherited&quot; this feature from
C.
<p>NOTE: If we had used an array-like <em>class</em> (e.g., <tt>vector&lt;Derived&gt;</tt> from
<a href="class-libraries.html#[32.1]">STL<!--rawtext:[32.1]:rawtext--></a>) instead of using a raw array, this problem would have been
properly trapped as an error at compile time rather than a run-time disaster.

<h3>[21.5] Does array-of-<tt>Derived</tt> is-<em>not</em>-a-kind-of
array-of-<tt>Base</tt> mean arrays are bad?</h3>
<p>Yes, arrays are evil.  (only half kidding).
<p>Seriously, arrays are very closely related to pointers, and pointers are
notoriously difficult to deal with.  But if you have a complete grasp of why
the above few FAQs were a problem from a design perspective (e.g., if you
really know why a container of <tt>Thing</tt> is not a kind-of container of
<tt>Anything</tt>), and if you think everyone else who will be maintaining your
code also has a full grasp on these OO design truths, then you should feel free
to use arrays.  But if you're like most people, you should use a template
container class such as <tt>vector&lt;T&gt;</tt> from <a href="class-libraries.html#[32.1]">STL<!--rawtext:[32.1]:rawtext--></a> rather than raw
arrays.

<h3>[21.6] Is a <tt>Circle</tt> a kind-of an <tt>Ellipse</tt>? <img src="updated.gif" alt="UPDATED!" border=0></h3>
<small><em>[Recently added a caveat that <tt>setSize(x,y)</tt> isn't sacred (on 1/97).  <a href="proper-inheritance.html#[21.7]">Click here to go to the next FAQ in the &quot;chain&quot; of recent changes<!--rawtext:[21.7]:rawtext--></a>.]</em></small>
<p>Not if <tt>Ellipse</tt> promises to be able to change its size asymmetrically.
<p>For example, suppose <tt>Ellipse</tt> has a <tt>setSize(x,y)</tt> member function, and
suppose this member function promises the <tt>Ellipse</tt>'s <tt>width()</tt> will be <tt>x</tt>,
and its <tt>height()</tt> will be <tt>y</tt>.  In this case, <tt>Circle</tt> can't be a kind-of
<tt>Ellipse</tt>.  Simply put, if <tt>Ellipse</tt> can do something <tt>Circle</tt> can't, then
<tt>Circle</tt> can't be a kind of <tt>Ellipse</tt>.
<p>This leaves two potential (valid) relationships between <tt>Circle</tt> and <tt>Ellipse</tt>:
<ul>
<li>Make <tt>Circle</tt> and <tt>Ellipse</tt> completely unrelated
classes</li>
<li>Derive <tt>Circle</tt> and <tt>Ellipse</tt> from a base class representing
&quot;Ellipses that can't <em>necessarily</em> perform an unequal-<tt>setSize()</tt>
operation&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>In the first case, Ellipse could be derived from <tt>class</tt> <tt>AsymmetricShape</tt>, and
<tt>setSize(x,y)</tt> could be introduced in <tt>AsymmetricShape</tt>.  However <tt>Circle</tt>
could be derived from <tt>SymmetricShape</tt> which has a <tt>setSize(size)</tt> member
function.
<p>In the second case, <tt>class</tt> <tt>Oval</tt> could only have <tt>setSize(size)</tt> which sets
both the <tt>width()</tt> and the <tt>height()</tt> to <tt>size</tt>.  <tt>Ellipse</tt> and <tt>Circle</tt>
could both inherit from <tt>Oval</tt>.  <tt>Ellipse</tt> &#151;but not <tt>Circle</tt>&#151; could add the
<tt>setSize(x,y)</tt> operation (but beware of the <a href="strange-inheritance.html#[23.3]">hiding rule<!--rawtext:[23.3]:rawtext--></a>
if the same member function name <tt>setSize()</tt> is used for both operations).
<p>(Note: this FAQ has to do with <tt>public</tt> inheritance; <a href="private-inheritance.html"><tt>private</tt> and <tt>protected</tt> inheritance<!--rawtext:[24]:rawtext--></a> are different.)
<p>(Note: <tt>setSize(x,y)</tt> isn't sacred.  Depending on your goals, it may be okay to
prevent users from changing the dimensions of an <tt>Ellipse</tt>, in which case it
would be a valid design choice to not have a <tt>setSize(x,y)</tt> method in
<tt>Ellipse</tt>.  However this series of FAQs discusses what to do when you want to
create a derived class of a <em>pre-existing</em> base class that has an
&quot;unacceptable&quot; method in it.  Of course the ideal situation is to discover this
problem when the base class doesn't yet exist.  But life isn't always ideal...)

<p>If you claim that all <tt>Ellipse</tt>s can be squashed asymmetrically, and you claim
that <tt>Circle</tt> is a kind-of <tt>Ellipse</tt>, and you claim that <tt>Circle</tt> can't be
squashed asymmetrically, clearly you've got to adjust (revoke, actually) one of
your claims.  Thus you've either got to get rid of
<tt>Ellipse::setSize(x,y)</tt>, get rid of the inheritance relationship between
<tt>Circle</tt> and <tt>Ellipse</tt>, or admit that your <tt>Circle</tt>s aren't necessarily
circular.
<p>Here are the two most common traps new OO/C++ programmers regularly fall into.
They attempt to use coding hacks to cover up a broken design (they redefine
<tt>Circle::setSize(x,y)</tt> to throw an exception, call <tt>abort()</tt>, choose the
average of the two parameters, or to be a no-op).  Unfortunately all these
hacks will surprise users, since users are expecting <tt>width()&nbsp;==&nbsp;x</tt> and
<tt>height()&nbsp;==&nbsp;y</tt>.  The one thing you must not do is surprise your users.
<p>If it is important to you to retain the &quot;<tt>Circle</tt> is a kind-of <tt>Ellipse</tt>&quot;
inheritance relationship, you can weaken the promise made by <tt>Ellipse</tt>'s
<tt>setSize(x,y)</tt>.  E.g., you could change the promise to, &quot;This member function
<em>might</em> set <tt>width()</tt> to <tt>x</tt> and/or it <em>might</em> set <tt>height()</tt> to
<tt>y</tt>, or it might do <em>nothing</em>&quot;.  Unfortunately this dilutes the contract
into dribble, since the user can't rely on any meaningful behavior.  The whole
hierarchy therefore begins to be worthless (it's hard to convince someone to
use an object if you have to shrug your shoulders when asked what the object
does for them).

<h3>[21.8] But I have a Ph.D. in Mathematics, and I'm

<small><em>[Recently added a caveat that <tt>setSize(x,y)</tt> isn't sacred (on 1/97).  <a href="strange-inheritance.html#[23.1]">Click here to go to the next FAQ in the &quot;chain&quot; of recent changes<!--rawtext:[23.1]:rawtext--></a>.]</em></small>
<p>Actually, it doesn't mean any of these things.  The sad reality is that it
means your intuition is wrong.
<p>Look, I have received and answered dozens of passionate e-mail messages about
this subject.  I have taught it hundreds of times to thousands of software
professionals all over the place.  I know it goes against your intuition.  But
trust me; your intuition is wrong.
<p>The real problem is your intuitive notion of &quot;kind of&quot; doesn't match the OO
notion of proper inheritance (technically called &quot;subtyping&quot;).  The bottom line
is that the derived class objects <em>must</em> be substitutable for the base
class objects.  In the case of <tt>Circle</tt>/<tt>Ellipse</tt>, the <tt>setSize(x,y)</tt> member
function violates this substitutability.
<p>You have three choices: [1] remove the <tt>setSize(x,y)</tt> member function from
<tt>Ellipse</tt> (thus breaking existing code that calls the <tt>setSize(x,y)</tt> member
function), [2] allow a <tt>Circle</tt> to have a different height than width (an
asymmetrical circle; hmmm), or [3] drop the inheritance relationship.  Sorry,
but there simply are no other choices.  Note that some people mention the
option of deriving both <tt>Circle</tt> and <tt>Ellipse</tt> from a third common base
class, but that's just a variant of option [3] above.
<p>Another way to say this is that you have to either make the base class weaker
(in this case braindamage <tt>Ellipse</tt> to the point that you can't set its width
and height to different values), or make the derived class stronger (in this
case empower a <tt>Circle</tt> with the ability to be both symmetric and, ahem,
asymmetric).  When neither of these is very satisfying (such as in the
<tt>Circle</tt>/<tt>Ellipse</tt> case), one normally simply removes the inheritance
relationship.  If the inheritance relationship simply <em>has</em> to exist, you
may need to remove the mutator member functions (<tt>setHeight(y)</tt>, <tt>setWidth(x)</tt>,
and <tt>setSize(x,y)</tt>) from the base class.

<h3>[21.9] But my problem doesn't have anything to do
with circles and ellipses, so what good is that silly example to me?</h3>
<p>Ahhh, there's the rub.  You <em>think</em> the <tt>Circle</tt>/<tt>Ellipse</tt> example is
just a silly example.  But in reality, <em>your</em> problem is an isomorphism
to that example.
<p>I don't care what your inheritance problem is, but all (yes <em>all</em>) bad
inheritances boil down to the <tt>Circle</tt>-is-not-a-kind-of-<tt>Ellipse</tt> example.
<p>Here's why: Bad inheritances always have a base class with an extra
capability (often an extra member function or two; sometimes an extra promise
made by one or a combination of member functions) that a derived class can't
satisfy.  You've either got to make the base class weaker, make the derived
class stronger, or eliminate the proposed inheritance relationship.  I've
seen lots and lots and lots of these bad inheritance proposals, and believe me,
they all boil down to the <tt>Circle</tt>/<tt>Ellipse</tt> example.
<p>Therefore, if you truly understand the <tt>Circle</tt>/<tt>Ellipse</tt> example, you'll be
able to recognize bad inheritance everywhere.  If you don't understand what's
going on with the <tt>Circle</tt>/<tt>Ellipse</tt> problem, the chances are high that you'll
make some very serious and very expensive inheritance mistakes.
<p>Sad but true.
<p>(Note: this FAQ has to do with <tt>public</tt> inheritance; <a href="private-inheritance.html"><tt>private</tt> and <tt>protected</tt> inheritance<!--rawtext:[24]:rawtext--></a> are different.)
