<h3>[6.1] Is C++ a practical language?</h3>
<p>Yes.
<p>C++ is a practical tool.  <a href="big-picture.html#[6.2]">It's not perfect<!--rawtext:[6.2]:rawtext--></a>, but
it's useful.
<p>In the world of industrial software, C++ is viewed as a solid, mature,
mainstream tool.  It has widespread industry support which makes it &quot;good&quot; from
an overall business perspective.

<h3>[6.2] Is C++ a perfect language?</h3>
<p>Nope.
<p>C++ wasn't designed to demonstrate what a perfect OO language looks like.  It
was designed to be a practical tool for solving real world problems.  It has a
few warts, but the only place where it's appropriate to keep fiddling with
something until it's perfect is in a pure academic setting.  That wasn't C++'s
goal.

<h3>[6.3] What's the big deal with OO?</h3>
<p>Object-oriented techniques are the best way we know of to develop large,
complex software applications and systems.
<p>OO hype: the software industry is &quot;failing&quot; to meet demands for large, complex
software systems.  But this &quot;failure&quot; is actually due to our <em>successes:</em>
our successes have propelled users to ask for more.  Unfortunately we created a
market hunger that the &quot;structured&quot; analysis, design and programming techniques
couldn't satisfy.  This required us to create a better paradigm.
<p>C++ is an OO programming language.  C++ can also be used as a traditional
programming language (as &quot;as a better C&quot;).  However if you use it &quot;as a better
C,&quot; don't expect to get the benefits of object-oriented programming.

<h3>[6.4] Is C++ better than Ada? (or Visual Basic, C, FORTRAN,
Pascal, Smalltalk, or any other language?)</h3>
<p>This question generates much <em>much</em> more heat than light.  Please read
the following before posting some variant of this question.
<p>In 99% of the cases, programming language selection is dominated by business
considerations, <em>not</em> by technical considerations.  Things that
<em>really</em> end up mattering are things like availability of a programming
environment for the development machine, availability of runtime environment(s)
for the deployment machine(s), licensing/legal issues of the runtime and/or
development environments, availability of trained developers, availability of
consulting services, and corporate culture/politics.  These business
considerations generally play a much greater role than compile time
performance, runtime performance, static <i>vs.</i> dynamic typing, static <i>vs.</i> dynamic
binding, etc.
<p>Anyone who argues in favor of one language over another in a purely technical
manner (i.e., who ignores the dominant business issues) exposes themself as a
techie weenie, and deserves not to be heard.

<h3>[6.5] Who uses C++?</h3>
<p>Lots and lots of companies and government sites.  Lots.
<p>The number of C++ developers doubles every year.  You can imagine that five
people are becomming C++ developers while you read this FAQ.
<p>Growth is one of several <a href="big-picture.html#[6.7]">critical features of C++<!--rawtext:[6.7]:rawtext--></a>.

<h3>[6.6] How long does it take to learn OO/C++?</h3>
<p>Companies like Paradigm Shift, Inc. <a href="mailto:info@parashift.com"><tt>info@parashift.com</tt></a>
successfully teach standard industry &quot;short courses,&quot; where we compress a
university semester course into one 40 hour work week.  But regardless of where
you get your training, make sure the courses have a hands-on element, since
most people learn best when they have projects to help the concepts &quot;gel.&quot;
But even if they have the <em>best</em> training, they're not ready yet.
<p>It takes 6-12 months to become proficient in OO/C++.  Less if the developers
have easy access to a &quot;local&quot; body of experts, more if there isn't a &quot;good&quot;
general purpose C++ class library available.  To become one of these experts
who can mentor others takes around 3 years.
<p>Some people never make it.  You don't have a chance unless you are teachable
and have personal drive.  As a bare minimum on &quot;teachability,&quot; you have to be
able to admit when you've are wrong.  As a bare minimum on &quot;drive,&quot; you must be
willing to put in some extra hours (it's a <em>lot</em> easier to learn some new
facts than it is to change your paradigm [i.e., to change the <em>way</em> you
think; to change your notion of goodness; to change your mental model of the
world of technology]).
<p>Two things you <em>should</em> do:
<ul>
<li><a href="how-to-learn-cpp.html#[26.1]">Bring in a &quot;mentor&quot;<!--rawtext:[26.1]:rawtext--></a></li>
<li>Get your people two books: one <a href="how-to-learn-cpp.html#[26.6]">to tell them
what is legal<!--rawtext:[26.6]:rawtext--></a>, another <a href="how-to-learn-cpp.html#[26.5]">to tell them what is
moral<!--rawtext:[26.5]:rawtext--></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Two things you <em>should not</em> do:

<h3>[6.7] What are some features of C++ from a business perspective?</h3>
<p>Here are a few features of OO/C++ from a business perspective:
<ul>
<li>C++ has a <a href="big-picture.html#[6.5]">huge installed base<!--rawtext:[6.5]:rawtext--></a>, which means
you'll have <a href="big-picture.html#[6.4]">multi-vendor support for tools,
environments, consulting services, etc.<!--rawtext:[6.4]:rawtext--></a>, plus you'll have a very valuable
line-item on your resume</li>
<li>C++ lets developers provide <a href="classes-and-objects.html#[7.3]">simplified
interfaces<!--rawtext:[7.3]:rawtext--></a> to software chunks, which improves the
defect-rate when those chunks are (re)used</li>
<li>C++ lets you exploit developer's intuition through
<a href="operator-overloading.html#[13.2]">operator overloading<!--rawtext:[13.2]:rawtext--></a>, which reduces the learning
curve for (re)users</li>
<li>C++ <a href="classes-and-objects.html#[7.4]">localizes access<!--rawtext:[7.4]:rawtext--></a> to a software chunk,
which reduces the cost of changes.</li>
<li>C++ reduces the <a href="classes-and-objects.html#[7.5]">safety-<em>vs.</em>-usability tradeoff<!--rawtext:[7.5]:rawtext--></a>, which improves the cost of
(re)using a chunk of software.</li>
<li>C++ reduces the <a href="inline-functions.html#[9.2]">safety-<em>vs.</em>-speed
tradeoff<!--rawtext:[9.2]:rawtext--></a>, which improves defect rates without degrading
performance.</li>
<li>C++ gives you <a href="big-picture.html#[6.8]">inheritance and dynamic
binding<!--rawtext:[6.8]:rawtext--></a> which let <a href="big-picture.html#[6.9]">old code call new
code<!--rawtext:[6.9]:rawtext--></a>, making it possible to quickly

<h3>[6.8] Are <tt>virtual</tt> functions (dynamic binding) central to
OO/C++?</h3>
<p><em>Yes!</em>
<p>Without <a href="virtual-functions.html">virtual functions<!--rawtext:[20]:rawtext--></a>, C++ is just a
syntactic variant of C.  <a href="operator-overloading.html">Operator overloading<!--rawtext:[13]:rawtext--></a>
and non-<tt>virtual</tt> member functions are great, but they are, after all, just
syntactic sugar for the more typical C notion of passing a pointer to a
<tt>struct</tt> to a function.
<p>From a business perspective, C++ without <tt>virtual</tt> functions has very little
value-add over straight C.  Technical people often think that there is a large
difference between C and non-OO C++, but without OO, difference usually isn't
enough to justify the cost of training developers, new tools, etc.  In other
words, if I were to advise a manager regarding whether to switch from C to
non-OO C++ (i.e., to switch languages but not paradigms), I'd probably
discourage him or her unless there were compelling tool-oriented reasons.  From
a business perspective, OO can help make systems extensible andadaptable, but
just the syntax of C++ classes without OO may not even reduce the maintenance
cost, and it surely adds to the training cost significantly.
<p>Bottom line: C++ without <tt>virtual</tt> is not OO.  Programming with classes but
without dynamic binding is called &quot;object based,&quot; but not &quot;object oriented.&quot;
Throwing out <tt>virtual</tt> functions is the same as throwing out OO.  All you have
left is object-based programming, similar to the original Ada language (the new
Ada language, by the way, supports true OO rather than just object-based
programming).

<h3>[6.9] I'm from Missouri.  Can you give me a simple
reason why <tt>virtual</tt> functions (dynamic binding) make a big difference?</h3>
<p>Overview: Dynamic binding can improve reuse by letting <em>old</em> code call
<em>new</em> code.
<p>Before OO came along, reuse was accomplished by having new code call old code.
For example, a programmer might write some code that called some reusable code
such as <tt>printf()</tt>.
<p>With OO, reuse can also be accomplished by having <em>old</em> code call
<em>new</em> code.  For example, a programmer might write some code that is
called by a framework that was written by their great, great grandfather.
There's no need to change great-great-grandpa's code.  In fact, it doesn't even
need to be recompiled.  Even if all you have left is the object file and the
source code that great-great-grandpa wrote was lost 25 years ago, that ancient
object file will call the new extension without anything falling apart.
<p><em>That</em> is extensibility, and <em>that</em> is OO.

<h3>[6.10] Is C++ backward compatible with ANSI/ISO-C?</h3>
<p>Almost.
<p>C++ is as close as possible to compatible with C, but no closer.  In practice,
the major difference is that C++ requires prototypes, and that <tt>f()</tt> declares a
function that takes no parameters (in C, <tt>f()</tt> is the same as <tt>f(...)</tt>).
<p>There are some very subtle differences as well, like <tt>sizeof('x')</tt> is equal to
<tt>sizeof(char)</tt> in C++ but is equal to <tt>sizeof(int)</tt> in C.  Also, C++ puts
structure &quot;tags&quot; in the same namespace as other names, whereas C requires an
explicit <tt>struct</tt> (e.g., the <tt>typedef&nbsp;struct&nbsp;Fred&nbsp;Fred;</tt> technique still
works, but is redundant in C++).

<h3>[6.11] Are there any C++ standardization efforts underway?</h3>
<p>Yes; ANSI (American) and ISO (International) groups are working closely with
each other.  The ANSI-C++ committee is called &quot;X3J16&quot;.  The ISO C++ standards
group is called &quot;WG21&quot;.  The major players in the ANSI/ISO C++ standards
process includes just about everyone:
<p>AT&amp;T, IBM, DEC, HP, Sun, MS, Borland, Zortech, Apple, OSF, etc ad nauseum.
Dozens of people attend each meeting.  People come from USA, UK, Japan,
Germany, Sweden, Denmark, France, ... (all have &quot;local&quot; committees sending
official representatives and conducting &quot;local&quot; meetings).
