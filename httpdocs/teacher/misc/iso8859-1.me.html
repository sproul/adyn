How to express accented characters when reviewing translations
</h2>
European languages are expressed on computers using a different character set from the one used in English-speaking countries.  This character set is capable of expressing the various adornments (e.g., umlauts, accents, etc.) so common in European languages.  Unfortunately, it is a tricky business to use this character set in my computer environment.  So instead I am expressing these adornments using a simple scheme where the modified standard letter is preceded by a standard character indicating what adornment is being shown.
<pre>
Adornment	preceding character
---------	-------------------
umlaut		: (colon)
accent grave	` (back apostrophe, from the key on the upper left of your keyboard, below the escape key)
accent acute	/ (slash)
circumflex	^ (carat, i.e., shift-6)
tilde		~ (tilde, from the key on the upper left of your keyboard, below the escape key))
</pre>


Thus the French word for "summer" can be expressed by "/et/e."
