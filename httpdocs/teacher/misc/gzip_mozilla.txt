To this end a new Apache 1.3 server module has been written. It is activated on a per-directory basis with a command in the access.conf file of the format: 


CompressContent Yes 

When activated, and only if an Accept-encoding: gzip header is received, all requests for files from that directory will be redirected to requests for an equivalent compressed file from that directory if one exists. In essence if you ask for foo.html and both it and foo.html.gz exist then those requests with an appropriate Accept-encoding will get the compressed file, and other requests will get the uncompressed file.
