    faq1("What is teacher", "teacher is a software tool that assists memorization.")
    faq1("How many exercises are there", "At the last count, over 14,000 exercises for each of the supported languages (currently Italian, German, Spanish, and French).")
    faq1("How does the software know what exercises I should review", "The software keeps track of how <i>interesting</i> each flashcard is to each user by associating a numerical weight with each flashcard for each user.  The <i>heavier</i> a flashcard is, the more interesting it is for the user.  Each time the user sees a flashcard and clicks on the <b>Keep flashcard</b> button, the weight for that particular flashcard goes up.  Conversely, each time the user sees a flashcard and clicks on the Discard flashcard button, that flashcard's weight goes down.  The flashcards start with a weight of zero; flashcards with large positive weights are the most likely to be retrieved for the user as Review exercises.")
    faq1("Where can I send feedback on the product", "Send feedback to <a href='mailto:nelson@adyn.com?subject=feedback' alt='mail nelson@adyn.com'>teacher support</a>. Alternatively, if you want to send feedback relating to a particular exercise, click on the <b>Contact us</b> button in the exercise.  A text box will appear where you can write your comments.  Once you click the <b>Send</b> button, your message will be forwarded to the software author.")
    faq1("What if you suddenly think of a verb you'd like help with - how do you get back to the verb list", "There are two ways you can accomplish this: <ul> <li> If you decided that you didn't want to work on the current set of exercises anymore, you would click on the <i>Change topic</i> button; this would discard the current set of exercises and take you to the exercise selection form, where you would select the verb that you are interested (assuming that it is on the list, which is not a given since the list only contains around 150 of the most common verbs (however, the most interesting irregular verbs should all be there).</li> <li>If you decided that you wanted to study some verb in addition to the current set of exercises, you would click on the <i>New topic</i> button; this would open up a new window which would show you the exercise selection form, from which you would attempt to study the new verb, if it is common enough to be among the hundred-or-so verbs for which teacher has exclusive sets of exercises.  Note that if you have this inspiration when seeing an instance of the verb in exercise, then usually you can simply click through a link in the footnotes to begin an additional session exclusively dedicated to drilling that verb.</li> </ul>")
    faq1("If I see something that is wrong or buggy, how should I report it", "Click on the <i>Contact us</i> button below the exercises. This will cause an e-mail to be composed with the subject containing the ID of the exercise where the problem was seen. (Of course it will be up to you to detail what was wrong.)")
