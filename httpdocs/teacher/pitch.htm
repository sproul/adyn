Nice to see you + Trey the other day.  The software study aid for foreign-language students that I wrote is, for want of a better name, called teacher and have it up at http://54.244.153.159:81.  I made a user for you called shari w/ a password of bg1.  (Sorry for the delay -- my day job has been a bit demanding recently.  Apparently my management believes foreign language study software shouldn't be my top priority -- I, of course, heartily disagree.  :))
<p>
The software is essentially online flashcards, but with most of the exercises in terms of sentences (which at least for my brain stick a little better than individual words). The exercises have weights which are tracked for each user; if a user struggles with an exercise, its weight increases along with the likelihood that that particular exercise will be shown again in future sessions.
<p>
The idea is to automatically direct students to the exercises which they have had the hardest time with. The translations are footnoted with grammatical peculiarities explained. Verbs are linked to conjugation tables.  This isn't a testing tool in that the user simply sees the question, visualizes the answer, and then clicks to show the answer; then the user determines whether to, for this session, discard this exercise or keep it.  Thus this tool which doesn't force students to do anything, any more than a set of flashcards would force a student to do something.

Anyway, if you think it would fit with what you are doing, I would be happy if it were useful.
