For most of the projects that I have<br>worked on there have been at least occasional crunches. But when that<br>happens, I step up my efforts in order to meet my obligations, whether<br>that means working on weekends or late at night. In one of my jobs, I<br>averaged 60 hour weeks for over a year. The way I see it, this is not an<br>ideal lifestyle, but I\'m willing to do whatever needs to be done to<br>accomplish our goals. [Tell me more about this situation where you worked<br>60 hours a week. Why was that necessary?] This was when I was working<br>for Sybase; I was asked to handle the code line administration and build<br>responsibilities for the connectivity division. The thing with this job<br>was that there was a moment-by-moment had the flow of requests that had to<br>be satisfied right away, but also a huge need for work on the software<br>infrastructure in order to automate a lot of the processes. This position<br>had been left to pretty junior people who weren\'t capable of seeing the<br>big picture and figuring out how the work could be reorganized to make it<br>a low bit more manageable. We had very recently taken on a bunch of new<br>platforms and the lack of a reliable build and has infrastructure and only<br>just become perceived as a significant problem. So I took on the<br>responsibility to deal with this and it was a very intense job because<br>during the day there were constant requests that needed to be satisfied<br>immediately, and so the way it worked, I ended up doing what I needed to<br>do to satisfy those requests, and then working late to develop the<br>software required to automate the builds and the maintenance of our code<br>lines on the various platforms. This ended up being a lengthy battle, but<br>the eventual results were very gratifying.<br><p><br>[Other examples?]<br><p><br>At Extensity it was a fairly constant theme that I was brought in to help<br>with projects that were in trouble. Here the problem was that we had a<br>product which was very complex and fragile, and also just the role of the<br>group lent itself to high-pressure: we were in direct contact with<br>customers whose processes were very dependent on what we could do for<br>them. And it didn\'t help that the product was very expensive, and so<br>customers\' expectations were generally pretty high. ',

However, the more<br>people who are involved, the more overhead you have coordinating between<br>them. So I think there is a trade-off which has to be judged according to<br>the nature of the problem being solved. If we\'re talking about a simple,<br>well understood problem, then I would prefer to work alone and just get it<br>done immediately. But if the problem is complex and not well understood,<br>then I think working together can result in fewer mistakes and<br>misunderstandings. I think this is especially true in situations where<br>the requirements are in flux, and there\'s a significant risk of doing work<br>which isn\'t going to match what is wanted by the end of the project. Then<br>I think working closely together can lead to really big savings in time<br>and effort.<br><p><br>Sure -- in my work at Extensity where I was integrating<br>customers\' accounting systems with our product, the work was very<br>dependent on exactly satisfying the customer\'s requirements, and often<br>these requirements were not specified very well. This was definitely a<br>case where, although the work was not necessarily that complex, since we<br>did not have great knowledge or familiarity with the customer\'s specific<br>systems, there was a big risk of implementing software which would not<br>conform to the customer\'s environment. So in this type of situation, I<br>thought it was extremely beneficial to keeping close contact with the<br>customer, always making sure that we were on the same page. When I was<br>working with AirTouch, I frequently integrated my software with my<br>counterpart\'s system, meaning that we had a fairly constant sanity check<br>on what we were doing; I was never in a situation where I was doing lots<br>of work which he hadn\'t seen yet, and so we could be pretty confident that<br>we were progressing toward our goal. The result in this project was that<br>we were able to make everything work without any significant missteps.<br>And an example of where working alone was beneficial: when I was<br>at Aion I wrote the database integration for the product. Although the<br>task involved lots of code and was fairly complex, I did the work with no<br>specification and no written design or review before the work was done.<br>Normally I would not be that comfortable with such a situation, but here<br>the problem was very well understood -- I knew what the interface was<br>going to be on our product\'s side, and it was just a question of making<br>the product work with all kinds of SQL data, and implementing it in clean,<br>documented code which would be easy to maintain. I knew exactly how to do<br>this, and not needing to coordinate with anyone else on the work made it<br>go a lot faster. ',
