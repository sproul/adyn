<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<h2>What is this product? </h2>

Reduced to its essentials, this product is an online version of flash cards with
<ul>
<li>links to grammatical references </li>
<li>links to verb tables</li>
<li>automatic customizing to the needs of individual users</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sample Screen #1: Prompt</h2>

For each exercise there is a prompt page and an answer page which serve the same function as the two sides of a flashcard.  First the user is shown the prompt page, a sample of which is shown below.  Just like with a flashcard, the user sees the prompt -- in this case, "We live in Britain" -- then translates it into the foreign language.
<p>
When the user is ready to see the answer, he clicks on the <b> Show Answer</b> button, resulting in the answer page being displayed; this is analogous to flipping the flashcard:

<h2>Sample Screen #2: Answer</h2>
It is expected that most of the time a user will be interested in a single foreign language, in which case only that language will be displayed.  In this case, the user was more ambitious, and decided to study them all simultaneously.
<p>
Each translation is explained in detail with hyperlinks to the appropriate sections of the online grammatical references.  Each time a verb is used, it is footnoted and linked to a complete conjugation of that verb.  Frequently there are also links to exercises pertaining to that particular verb; by following these links, the user can concentrate on a problem verb if desired.
<p>
There are many exercises, over 14,000 at last count.  When selecting exercises, the user has the ability to focus on particular verbs and/or particular tenses, among other criteria.
